v</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p>It is claimed for the following book of some five hundred pages that the
larger part of it is an addition of entirely new material to the romantic 
story of the Bront&euml;s.&nbsp; For this result, but very small credit is 
due to me; and my very hearty acknowledgments must be made, in the first 
place, to the Rev. Arthur Bell Nicholls, for whose generous surrender of 
personal inclination I must ever be grateful.&nbsp; It has been with 
extreme unwillingness that Mr. Nicholls has broken the silence of forty 
years, and he would not even now have consented to the publication of 
certain letters concerning his marriage, had he not been aware that these 
letters were already privately printed and in the hands of not less than 
eight or ten people.&nbsp; To Miss Ellen Nussey of Gomersall, I have also 
to render thanks <!-- page vi--><a name="pagevi"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. vi</span>for having placed the many letters in her 
possession at my disposal, and for having furnished a great deal of 
interesting information.&nbsp; Without the letters from Charlotte 
Bront&euml; to Mr. W. S. Williams, which were kindly lent to me by his son 
and daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Thornton Williams, my book would have been the 
poorer.&nbsp; Sir Wemyss Reid, Mr. J. J. Stead, of Heckmondwike, Mr. Butler
Wood, of Bradford, Mr. W. W. Yates, of Dewsbury, Mr. Erskine Stuart, Mr. 
Buxton Forman, and Mr. Thomas J. Wise are among the many Bront&euml; 
specialists who have helped me with advice or with the loan of 
material.&nbsp; Mr. Wise, in particular, has lent me many valuable 
manuscripts.&nbsp; Finally, I have to thank my friend Dr. Robertson Nicoll 
for the kindly pressure which has practically compelled me to prepare this 
little volume amid a multitude of journalistic duties.</p>

1</span>PRELIMINARY: MRS. GASKELL</h2>
<p>In the whole of English biographical literature there is no book that 
can compare in widespread interest with the <i>Life of Charlotte 
Bront&euml;</i> by Mrs. Gaskell.&nbsp; It has held a position of singular 
popularity for forty years; and while biography after biography has come 
and gone, it still commands a place side by side with Boswell&rsquo;s 
<i>Johnson</i> and Lockhart&rsquo;s <i>Scott</i>.&nbsp; As far as mere 
readers are concerned, it may indeed claim its hundreds as against the tens
of intrinsically more important rivals.&nbsp; There are obvious reasons for
this success.&nbsp; Mrs. Gaskell was herself a popular novelist, who 
commanded a very wide audience, and <i>Cranford</i>, at least, has taken a 
place among the classics of our literature.&nbsp; She brought to bear upon 
the biography of Charlotte Bront&euml; all those literary gifts which had 
made the charm of her seven volumes of romance.&nbsp; And these gifts were 
employed upon a romance of real life, not less fascinating than anything 
which imagination could have furnished.&nbsp; Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s
success as an author turned the eyes of the world upon her.&nbsp; Thackeray
had sent her his <i>Vanity Fair</i> before he knew her name or sex.&nbsp; 
The precious volume lies before me&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/firstsignature.jpg">
<img alt="First Thackeray Inscription" src="images/firstsignature.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>And 
Thackeray did not send many inscribed copies of his books even to 
successful authors.&nbsp; Speculation concerning the author of <i>Jane 
Eyre</i> was sufficiently rife during those seven sad years of literary 
renown to make a biography imperative when death came to Charlotte 
Bront&euml; in 1855.&nbsp; All the world had heard something of the three 
marvellous sisters, daughters of a poor parson in Yorkshire, going one 
after another to their death with such melancholy swiftness, but 
leaving&mdash;two of them, at least&mdash;imperishable work behind 
them.&nbsp; The old blind father and the bereaved husband read the confused
eulogy and criticism, sometimes with a sad pleasure at the praise, oftener 
with a sadder pain at the grotesque inaccuracy.&nbsp; Small wonder that it 
became impressed upon Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s mind that an authoritative 
biography was desirable.&nbsp; His son-in-law, Mr. Arthur Bell Nicholls, 
who lived with him in the Haworth parsonage during the six weary years 
which succeeded Mrs. Nicholls&rsquo;s death, was not so readily won to the 
unveiling of his wife&rsquo;s inner life; and although we, who read Mrs. 
Gaskell&rsquo;s <i>Memoir</i>, have every reason to be thankful for Mr. 
Bront&euml;&rsquo;s decision, peace of mind would undoubtedly have been 
more assured to Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s surviving relatives had the 
most rigid silence been maintained.&nbsp; The book, when it appeared in 
1857, gave infinite pain to a number of people, including Mr. Bront&euml; 
and Mr. Nicholls; and Mrs. Gaskell&rsquo;s subsequent experiences had the 
effect of persuading her that all biographical literature was intolerable 
and undesirable.&nbsp; She would seem to have given instructions that no 
biography of herself should be written; and now that thirty years have 
passed since her death we have no substantial record of one of the most 
fascinating women of her age.&nbsp; The loss to literature has been 
forcibly brought home to the present writer, who has in his possession a 
bundle of letters written by Mrs. Gaskell to numerous friends of Charlotte 
Bront&euml; during the progress of the biography.&nbsp; They serve, <!-- 
page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>all of them, 
to impress one with the singular charm of the woman, her humanity and 
breadth of sympathy.&nbsp; They make us think better of Mrs. Gaskell, as 
Thackeray&rsquo;s letters to Mrs. Brookfield make us think better of the 
author of <i>Vanity Fair</i>.</p>
<p>Apart from these letters, a journey in the footsteps, as it were, of 
Mrs. Gaskell reveals to us the remarkable conscientiousness with which she 
set about her task.&nbsp; It would have been possible, with so much fame 
behind her, to have secured an equal success, and certainly an equal 
pecuniary reward, had she merely written a brief monograph with such 
material as was voluntarily placed in her hands.&nbsp; Mrs. Gaskell 
possessed a higher ideal of a biographer&rsquo;s duties.&nbsp; She spared 
no pains to find out the facts; she visited every spot associated with the 
name of Charlotte Bront&euml;&mdash;Thornton, Haworth, Cowan Bridge, 
Birstall, Brussels&mdash;and she wrote countless letters to the friends of 
Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s earlier days.</p>
<p>But why, it may be asked, was Mrs. Gaskell selected as biographer?&nbsp;
The choice was made by Mr. Bront&euml;, and not, as has been suggested, by 
some outside influence.&nbsp; When Mr. Bront&euml; had once decided that 
there should be an authoritative biography&mdash;and he alone was active in
the matter&mdash;there could be but little doubt upon whom the task would 
fall.&nbsp; Among all the friends whom fame had brought to Charlotte, Mrs. 
Gaskell stood prominent for her literary gifts and her large-hearted 
sympathy.&nbsp; She had made the acquaintance of Miss Bront&euml; when the 
latter was on a visit to Sir James Kay Shuttleworth, in 1850; and a letter 
from Charlotte to her father, and others to Mr. W. S. Williams, indicate 
the beginning of a friendship which was to leave so permanent a record in 
literary history:&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;20<i>th</i> <i>November</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You said that if I 
wished for any copies <!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>of <i>Shirley</i> to be sent to individuals I 
was to name the parties.&nbsp; I have thought of one person to whom I 
should much like a copy to be offered&mdash;Harriet Martineau.&nbsp; For 
her character&mdash;as revealed in her works&mdash;I have a lively 
admiration, a deep esteem.&nbsp; Will you inclose with the volume the 
accompanying note?</p>
<p>&lsquo;The letter you forwarded this morning was from Mrs. Gaskell, 
authoress of <i>Mary Barton</i>; she said I was not to answer it, but I 
cannot help doing so.&nbsp; The note brought the tears to my eyes.&nbsp; 
She is a good, she is a great woman.&nbsp; Proud am I that I can touch a 
chord of sympathy in souls so noble.&nbsp; In Mrs. Gaskell&rsquo;s nature 
it mournfully pleases me to fancy a remote affinity to my sister 
Emily.&nbsp; In Miss Martineau&rsquo;s mind I have always felt the same, 
though there are wide differences.&nbsp; Both these ladies are above 
me&mdash;certainly far my superiors in attainments and experience.&nbsp; I 
think I could look up to them if I knew them.&mdash;I am, dear sir, yours 
sincerely,</p>

<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>November</i> 29<i>th</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I inclose two notes 
for postage.&nbsp; The note you sent yesterday was from Harriet Martineau; 
its contents were more than gratifying.&nbsp; I ought to be thankful, and I
trust I am, for such testimonies of sympathy from the first order of 
minds.&nbsp; When Mrs. Gaskell tells me she shall keep my works as a 
treasure for her daughters, and when Harriet Martineau testifies 
affectionate approbation, I feel the sting taken from the strictures of 
another class of critics.&nbsp; My resolution of seclusion withholds me 
from communicating further with these ladies at present, but I now know how
they are inclined to me&mdash;I know how my writings have affected their 
wise and pure minds.&nbsp; The knowledge is present support and, perhaps, 
may be future armour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trust Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s health and, consequently, your 
spirits are by this time quite restored.&nbsp; If all be well, perhaps I 
shall see you next week.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>January</i> 1<i>st</i>, 1850.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;May I beg that a 
copy of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> may be sent to Mrs. Gaskell; her present 
address is 3 Sussex Place, Regent&rsquo;s Park.&nbsp; She has just sent me 
the <i>Moorland Cottage</i>.&nbsp; I felt disappointed about the 
publication of that book, having hoped it would be offered to Smith, Elder 
&amp; Co.; but it seems she had no alternative, as it was Mr. Chapman 
himself who asked her to write a Christmas book.&nbsp; On my return home 
yesterday I found two packets from Cornhill directed in two well-known 
hands waiting for me.&nbsp; You are all very very good.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trust to have derived benefit from my visit to Miss 
Martineau.&nbsp; A visit more interesting I certainly never paid.&nbsp; If 
self-sustaining strength can be acquired from example, I ought to have got 
good.&nbsp; But my nature is not hers; I could not make it so though I were
to submit it seventy times seven to the furnace of affliction, and 
discipline it for an age under the hammer and anvil of toil and 
self-sacrifice.&nbsp; Perhaps if I was like her I should not admire her so 
much as I do.&nbsp; She is somewhat absolute, though quite unconsciously 
so; but she is likewise kind, with an affection at once abrupt and 
constant, whose sincerity you cannot doubt.&nbsp; It was delightful to sit 
near her in the evenings and hear her converse, myself mute.&nbsp; She 
speaks with what seems to me a wonderful fluency and eloquence.&nbsp; Her 
animal spirits are as unflagging as her intellectual powers.&nbsp; I was 
glad to find her health excellent.&nbsp; I believe neither solitude nor 
loss of friends would break her down.&nbsp; I saw some faults in her, but 
somehow I liked them for the sake of her good points.&nbsp; It gave me no 
pain to feel insignificant, mentally and corporeally, in comparison with 
her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trusting that you and yours are well, and sincerely wishing you 
all a happy new year,&mdash;I am, my dear sir, yours sincerely,</p>

yesterday evening at eight <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span

tedious journey.&nbsp; I had to change carriages three times and to wait an
hour and a half at Lancaster.&nbsp; Sir James came to meet me at the 
station; both he and Lady Shuttleworth gave me a very kind reception.&nbsp;
This place is exquisitely beautiful, though the weather is cloudy, misty, 
and stormy; but the sun bursts out occasionally and shows the hills and the
lake.&nbsp; Mrs. Gaskell is coming here this evening, and one or two other 
people.&nbsp; Miss Martineau, I am sorry to say, I shall not see, as she is
already gone from home for the autumn.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be kind enough to write by return of post and tell me how you are

<p>And this is how she writes to a friend from Haworth, on her return, 
after that first meeting:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Lady Shuttleworth never got out, being confined to the house with
a cold; but fortunately there was Mrs. Gaskell, the authoress of <i>Mary 
Barton</i>, who came to the Briery the day after me.&nbsp; I was truly glad
of her companionship.&nbsp; She is a woman of the most genuine talent, of 
cheerful, pleasing, and cordial manners, and, I believe, of a kind and good
heart.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>September</i> 20<i>th</i>, 1850.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I herewith send you
a very roughly written copy of what I have to say about my sisters.&nbsp; 
When you have read it you can better judge whether the word 
&ldquo;Notice&rdquo; or &ldquo;Memoir&rdquo; is the most appropriate.&nbsp;
I think the former.&nbsp; Memoir seems to me to express a more 
circumstantial and different sort of account.&nbsp; My aim is to give a 
just idea of their identity, not to write any narration of their simple, 
uneventful lives.&nbsp; I depend on you for faithfully pointing out 
whatever may strike you as faulty.&nbsp; I could not write it in the 
conventional form&mdash;<i>that</i> I found impossible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It gives me real pleasure to hear of your son&rsquo;s 
success.&nbsp; I <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>trust he may persevere and go on improving, and give his parents 
cause for satisfaction and honest pride.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am truly pleased, too, to learn that Miss Kavanagh has managed 
so well with Mr. Colburn.&nbsp; Her position seems to me one deserving of 
all sympathy.&nbsp; I often think of her.&nbsp; Will her novel soon be 
published?&nbsp; Somehow I expect it to be interesting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I certainly did hope that Mrs. Gaskell would offer her next work 
to Smith &amp; Elder.&nbsp; She and I had some conversation about 
publishers&mdash;a comparison of our literary experiences was made.&nbsp; 
She seemed much struck with the differences between hers and mine, though I
did not enter into details or tell her all.&nbsp; Unless I greatly mistake,
she and you and Mr. Smith would get on well together; but one does not know
what causes there may be to prevent her from doing as she would wish in 
such a case.&nbsp; I think Mr. Smith will not object to my occasionally 
sending her any of the Cornhill books that she may like to see.&nbsp; I 
have already taken the liberty of lending her Wordsworth&rsquo;s 
<i>Prelude</i>, as she was saying how much she wished to have the 
opportunity of reading it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not tack remembrances to Mrs. Williams and your daughters 
and Miss Kavanagh to all my letters, because that makes an empty form of 
what should be a sincere wish, but I trust this mark of courtesy and 
regard, though rarely expressed, is always understood.&mdash;Believe me, 
yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Miss Bront&euml; twice visited Mrs. Gaskell in her Manchester home, 
first in 1851 and afterwards in 1853, and concerning this latter visit we 
have the following letter:&mdash;</p>

suit you if I were to come next Thursday, the 21st?</p>
<p>&lsquo;If that day tallies with your convenience, and if my father 
continues as well as he is now, I know of no engagement on my part which 
need compel me longer to defer the pleasure of seeing you.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

o&rsquo;clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>&nbsp; That, I think, would be
about your tea-time, and, of course, I should dine before leaving 
home.&nbsp; I always like evening for an arrival; it seems more cosy and 
pleasant than coming in about the busy middle of the day.&nbsp; I think if 
I stay a week that will be a very long visit; it will give you time to get 
well tired of me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Remember me very kindly to Mr. Gaskell and Marianna.&nbsp; As to 
Mesdames Flossy and Julia, those venerable ladies are requested beforehand 
to make due allowance for the awe with which they will be sure to impress a

<p>In the autumn of 1853 Mrs. Gaskell returned Charlotte 
Bront&euml;&rsquo;s visit at Haworth.&nbsp; She was not, however, at 
Charlotte&rsquo;s wedding in Haworth Church. <a name="citation8"></a><a

was truly kind, and made me warmly wish to join you.&nbsp; My prospects, 
however, of being able to leave home continue very unsettled.&nbsp; I am 
expecting Mrs. Gaskell next week or the week after, the day being yet 
undetermined.&nbsp; She was to have come in June, but then my severe attack
of influenza rendered it impossible that I should receive or entertain 
her.&nbsp; Since that time she has been absent on the Continent with her 
husband and two eldest girls; and just before I received yours I had a 
letter from her volunteering a visit at a vague date, which I requested her
to fix as soon as possible.&nbsp; My father has been much better during the

<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>But 
the friendship, which commenced so late in Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s 
life, never reached the stage of downright intimacy.&nbsp; Of this there is
abundant evidence in the biography; and Mrs. Gaskell was forced to rely 
upon the correspondence of older friends of Charlotte&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mr. 
George Smith, the head of the firm of Smith and Elder, furnished some 
twenty letters.&nbsp; Mr. W. S. Williams, to whom is due the credit of 
&lsquo;discovering&rsquo; the author of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, lent others; and 
another member of Messrs. Smith and Elder&rsquo;s staff, Mr. James Taylor, 
furnished half-a-dozen more; but the best help came from another 
quarter.</p>
<p>Of the two schoolfellows with whom Charlotte Bront&euml; regularly 
corresponded from childhood till death, Mary Taylor and Ellen Nussey, the 
former had destroyed every letter; and thus it came about that by far the 
larger part of the correspondence in Mrs. Gaskell&rsquo;s biography was 
addressed to Miss Ellen Nussey, now as &lsquo;My dearest Nell,&rsquo; now 
simply as &lsquo;E.&rsquo;&nbsp; The unpublished correspondence in my 
hands, which refers to the biography, opens with a letter from Mrs. Gaskell
to Miss Nussey, dated July 6th, 1855.&nbsp; It relates how, in accordance 
with a request from Mr. Bront&euml;, she had undertaken to write the work, 
and had been over to Haworth.&nbsp; There she had made the acquaintance of 
Mr. Nicholls for the first time.&nbsp; She told Mr. Bront&euml; how much 
she felt the difficulty of the task she had undertaken.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
she sincerely desired to make his daughter&rsquo;s character known to all 
who took deep interest in her writings.&nbsp; Both Mr. Bront&euml; and Mr. 
Nicholls agreed to help to the utmost, although Mrs. Gaskell was struck by 
the fact that it was Mr. Nicholls, and not Mr. Bront&euml;, who was more 
intellectually alive to the attraction which such a book would have for the
public.&nbsp; His feelings were opposed to any biography at all; but he had
yielded to Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s &lsquo;impetuous wish,&rsquo; and he 
brought down all the materials he could find, in the shape of about a dozen
<!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
10</span>letters.&nbsp; Mr. Nicholls, moreover, told Mrs. Gaskell that Miss
Nussey was the person of all others to apply to; that she had been the 
friend of his wife ever since Charlotte was fifteen, and that he was 
writing to Miss Nussey to beg her to let Mrs. Gaskell see some of the 
correspondence.</p>
<p>But here is Mr. Nicholls&rsquo;s actual letter, unearthed after forty 
years, as well as earlier letters from and to Miss Nussey, which would seem
to indicate a suggestion upon the part of &lsquo;E&rsquo; that some attempt
should be made to furnish a biography of her friend&mdash;if only to set at
rest, once and for all, the speculations of the gossiping community with 
whom Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s personality was still shrouded in 
mystery; and indeed it is clear from these letters that it is to Miss 
Nussey that we really owe Mrs. Gaskell&rsquo;s participation in the 
matter:&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">TO REV. A. B. NICHOLLS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Brookroyd</span>, 
<i>June</i> 6<i>th</i>, 1855.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Nicholls</span>,&mdash;I have been 
much hurt and pained by the perusal of an article in <i>Sharpe</i> for this
month, entitled &ldquo;A Few Words about <i>Jane Eyre</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; You
will be certain to see the article, and I am sure both you and Mr. 
Bront&euml; will feel acutely the misrepresentations and the malignant 
spirit which characterises it.&nbsp; Will you suffer the article to pass 
current without any refutations?&nbsp; The writer merits the contempt of 
silence, but there will be readers and believers.&nbsp; Shall such be left 
to imbibe a tissue of malignant falsehoods, or shall an attempt be made to 
do justice to one who so highly deserved justice, whose very name those who
best knew her but speak with reverence and affection?&nbsp; Should not her 
aged father be defended from the reproach the writer coarsely attempts to 
bring upon him?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish Mrs. Gaskell, who is every way capable, would undertake a 
reply, and would give a sound castigation to the writer.&nbsp; Her personal
acquaintance with Haworth, the Parsonage, and its inmates, fits her for the
task, and if on other <!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>subjects she lacked information I would gladly 
supply her with facts sufficient to set aside much that is asserted, if you
yourself are not provided with all the information that is needed on the 
subjects produced.&nbsp; Will you ask Mrs. Gaskell to undertake this just 
and honourable defence?&nbsp; I think she would do it gladly.&nbsp; She 
valued dear Charlotte, and such an act of friendship, performed with her 
ability and power, could only add to the laurels she has already won.&nbsp;
I hope you and Mr. Bront&euml; are well.&nbsp; My kind regards to 
both.&mdash;Believe me, yours sincerely,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>June</i> 11<i>th</i>, 1855.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Nussey</span>,&mdash;We had not 
seen the article in <i>Sharpe</i>, and very possibly should not, if you had
not directed our attention to it.&nbsp; We ordered a copy, and have now 
read the &ldquo;Few Words about <i>Jane Eyre</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The writer 
has certainly made many mistakes, but apparently not from any unkind 
motive, as he professes to be an admirer of Charlotte&rsquo;s works, pays a
just tribute to her genius, and in common with thousands deplores her 
untimely death.&nbsp; His design seems rather to be to gratify the 
curiosity of the multitude in reference to one who had made such a 
sensation in the literary world.&nbsp; But even if the article had been of 
a less harmless character, we should not have felt inclined to take any 
notice of it, as by doing so we should have given it an importance which it
would not otherwise have obtained.&nbsp; Charlotte herself would have acted
thus; and her character stands too high to be injured by the statements in 
a magazine of small circulation and little influence&mdash;statements which
the writer prefaces with the remark that he does not vouch for their 
accuracy.&nbsp; The many laudatory notices of Charlotte and her works which
appeared since her death may well make us indifferent to the detractions of
a few envious or malignant persons, as there ever will be such.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The remarks respecting Mr. Bront&euml; excited in him only 
amusement&mdash;indeed, I have not seen him laugh as much for <!-- page 
12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>some months as 
he did while I was reading the article to him.&nbsp; We are both well in 
health, but lonely and desolate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Bront&euml; unites with me in kind regards.&mdash;Yours 
sincerely,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Nussey</span>,&mdash;Some other 
erroneous notices of Charlotte having appeared, Mr. Bront&euml; has deemed 
it advisable that some authentic statement should be put forth.&nbsp; He 
has therefore adopted your suggestion and applied to Mrs. Gaskell, who has 
undertaken to write a life of Charlotte.&nbsp; Mrs. Gaskell came over 
yesterday and spent a few hours with us.&nbsp; The greatest difficulty 
seems to be in obtaining materials to show the development of 
Charlotte&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; For this reason Mrs. Gaskell is anxious 
to see her letters, especially those of any early date.&nbsp; I think I 
understood you to say that you had some; if so, we should feel obliged by 
your letting us have any that you may think proper, not for publication, 
but merely to give the writer an insight into her mode of thought.&nbsp; Of
course they will be returned after a little time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I confess that the course most consonant with my own feelings 
would be to take no steps in the matter, but I do not think it right to 
offer any opposition to Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have the same object in view, but should differ in our mode of
proceeding.&nbsp; Mr. Bront&euml; has not been very well.&nbsp; Excitement 
on Sunday (our Rush-bearing) and Mrs. Gaskell&rsquo;s visit yesterday have 
been rather much for him.&mdash;Believe me, sincerely yours,</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaskell, however, wanted to make Miss Nussey&rsquo;s acquaintance, 
and asked if she might visit her; and added that she would also like to see
Miss Wooler, Charlotte&rsquo;s schoolmistress, if that lady were still 
alive.&nbsp; To this letter Miss Nussey made the following 
reply:&mdash;</p>

absence from home your letter has only just reached me.&nbsp; I had not 
heard of Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s request, but I am most heartily glad that 
he has made it.&nbsp; A letter from Mr. Nicholls was forwarded along with 
yours, which I opened first, and was thus prepared for your communication, 
the subject of which is of the deepest interest to me.&nbsp; I will do 
everything in my power to aid the righteous work you have undertaken, but I
feel my powers very limited, and apprehend that you may experience some 
disappointment that I cannot contribute more largely the information which 
you desire.&nbsp; I possess a great many letters (for I have destroyed but 
a small portion of the correspondence), but I fear the early letters are 
not such as to unfold the character of the writer except in a few 
points.&nbsp; You perhaps may discover more than is apparent to me.&nbsp; 
You will read them with a purpose&mdash;I perused them only with interests 
of affection.&nbsp; I will immediately look over the correspondence, and I 
promise to let you see all that I can confide to your friendly 
custody.&nbsp; I regret that my absence from home should have made it 
impossible for me to have the pleasure of seeing you at Brookroyd at the 
time you propose.&nbsp; I am engaged to stay here till Monday week, and 
shall be happy to see you any day you name after that date, or, if more 
convenient to you to come Friday or Saturday in next week, I will gladly 
return in time to give you the meeting.&nbsp; I am staying with our 
schoolmistress, Miss Wooler, in this place.&nbsp; I wish her very much to 
give me leave to ask you here, but she does not yield to my wishes; it 
would have been pleasanter to me to talk with you among these hills than 
sitting in my home and thinking of one who had so often been present 
there.&mdash;I am, my dear madam, yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaskell and Miss Nussey met, and the friendship which ensued was 
closed only by death; and indeed one <!-- page 14--><a 
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>of the most beautiful 
letters in the collection in my hands is one signed &lsquo;Meta 
Gaskell,&rsquo; and dated January 22, 1866.&nbsp; It tells in detail, with 
infinite tenderness and pathos, of her mother&rsquo;s last moments. <a 
name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14" class="citation">[14]</a>&nbsp;
That, however, was ten years later than the period with which we are 
concerned.&nbsp; In 1856 Mrs. Gaskell was energetically engaged upon a 
biography of her friend which should lack nothing of thoroughness, as she 
hoped.&nbsp; She claimed to have visited the scenes of all the incidents in
Charlotte&rsquo;s life, &lsquo;the two little pieces of private 
governess-ship excepted.&rsquo;&nbsp; She went one day with Mr. Smith to 
the Chapter Coffee House, where the sisters first stayed in London.&nbsp; 
Another day she is in Yorkshire, where she makes the acquaintance of Miss 
Wooler, which permitted, as she said, &lsquo;a more friendly manner of 
writing towards Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s old 
schoolmistress.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again she is in Brussels, where Madame 
H&eacute;ger refused to see her, although M. H&eacute;ger was kind and 
communicative, &lsquo;and very much indeed I both like and respect 
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her countless questions were exceedingly 
interesting.&nbsp; They covered many pages of note-paper.&nbsp; Did 
Branwell Bront&euml; know of the publication of <i>Jane Eyre</i>,&rsquo; 
she asks, &lsquo;and how did he receive the news?&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Gaskell
was persuaded in her own mind that he had never known of its publication, 
and we shall presently see that she was right.&nbsp; Charlotte had 
distinctly informed her, she said, that Branwell was not in a fit condition
at the time to be told.&nbsp; &lsquo;Where did the girls get the books 
which they read so continually?&nbsp; Did Emily accompany Charlotte as a 
pupil when the latter went as a teacher to Roe Head?&nbsp; Why did not 
Branwell go to the Royal Academy in London to learn painting?&nbsp; Did 
Emily ever go out as a governess?&nbsp; What were Emily&rsquo;s religious 
opinions?&nbsp; Did <i>she</i> ever make friends?&rsquo;&nbsp; Such were 
the questions which came quick and <!-- page 15--><a

<p style="text-align: center">TO MRS. GASKELL, <span 
class="smcap">Manchester</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Brookroyd</span>, 
<i>October</i> 22<i>nd</i>, 1856.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Gaskell</span>,&mdash;If you go 
to London pray try what may be done with regard to a portrait of dear 
Charlotte.&nbsp; It would greatly enhance the value and interest of the 
memoir, and be such a satisfaction to people to see something that would 
settle their ideas of the personal appearance of the dear departed 
one.&nbsp; It has been a surprise to every stranger, I think, that she was 
so gentle and lady-like to look upon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Emily Bront&euml; went to Roe Head as pupil when Charlotte went 
as teacher; she stayed there but two months; she never settled, and was ill
from nothing but home-sickness.&nbsp; Anne took her place and remained 
about two years.&nbsp; Emily was a teacher for one six months in a 
ladies&rsquo; school in Halifax or the neighbourhood.&nbsp; I do not know 
whether it was conduct or want of finances that prevented Branwell from 
going to the Royal Academy.&nbsp; Probably there were impediments of both 
kinds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid if you give me my name I shall feel a prominence in 
the book that I altogether shrink from.&nbsp; My very last wish would be to
appear in the book more than is absolutely necessary.&nbsp; If it were 
possible, I would choose not to be known at all.&nbsp; It is my friend only
that I care to see and recognise, though your framing and setting of the 
picture will very greatly enhance its value.&mdash;I am, my dear Mrs. 
Gaskell, yours very sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Ellen 
Nussey</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book was published in two volumes, under the title of <i>The Life of
Charlotte Bront&euml;</i>, in the spring of 1857.&nbsp; At first all was 
well.&nbsp; Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s earliest acknowledgment of the book was
one of approbation.&nbsp; Sir James Shuttleworth expressed the hope that 
Mr. Nicholls would &lsquo;rejoice that his wife would be known as a 
Christian heroine who could bear her cross with the firmness of a martyr 
saint.&rsquo;&nbsp; Canon <!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Kingsley wrote a charming letter to Mrs. 
Gaskell, published in his <i>Life</i>, and more than once reprinted 
since.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Let me renew our long interrupted acquaintance,&rsquo; he writes 
from St. Leonards, under date May 14th, 1857, &lsquo;by complimenting you 
on poor Miss Bront&euml;&rsquo;s <i>Life</i>.&nbsp; You have had a delicate
and a great work to do, and you have done it admirably.&nbsp; Be sure that 
the book will do good.&nbsp; It will shame literary people into some 
stronger belief that a simple, virtuous, practical home life is consistent 
with high imaginative genius; and it will shame, too, the prudery of a not 
over cleanly though carefully white-washed age, into believing that purity 
is now (as in all ages till now) quite compatible with the knowledge of 
evil.&nbsp; I confess that the book has made me ashamed of myself.&nbsp; 
<i>Jane Eyre</i> I hardly looked into, very seldom reading a work of 
fiction&mdash;yours, indeed, and Thackeray&rsquo;s, are the only ones I 
care to open.&nbsp; <i>Shirley</i> disgusted me at the opening, and I gave 
up the writer and her books with a notion that she was a person who liked 
coarseness.&nbsp; How I misjudged her! and how thankful I am that I never 
put a word of my misconceptions into print, or recorded my misjudgments of 
one who is a whole heaven above me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well have you done your work, and given us the picture of a 
valiant woman made perfect by suffering.&nbsp; I shall now read carefully 
and lovingly every word she has written, especially those poems, which 
ought not to have fallen dead as they did, and which seem to be (from a 
review in the current <i>Fraser</i>) of remarkable strength and 
purity.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a short-lived triumph, however, and Mrs. Gaskell soon found 
herself, as she expressed it, &lsquo;in a veritable hornet&rsquo;s 
nest.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Bront&euml;, to begin with, did not care for the 
references to himself and the suggestion that he had treated his wife 
unkindly.&nbsp; Mrs. Gaskell had associated him with numerous 
eccentricities and ebullitions of temper, which during his later years he 
always asserted, and <!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>undoubtedly with perfect truth, were, at the 
best, the fabrications of a dismissed servant.&nbsp; Mr. Nicholls had also 
his grievance.&nbsp; There was just a suspicion implied that he had not 
been quite the most sympathetic of husbands.&nbsp; The suspicion was 
absolutely ill-founded, and arose from Mr. Nicholls&rsquo;s intense 
shyness.&nbsp; But neither Mr. Bront&euml; nor Mr. Nicholls gave Mrs. 
Gaskell much trouble.&nbsp; They, at any rate, were silent.&nbsp; Trouble, 
however, came from many quarters.&nbsp; Yorkshire people resented the air 
of patronage with which, as it seemed to them, a good Lancashire lady had 
taken their county in hand.&nbsp; They were not quite the backward savages,
they retorted, which some of Mrs. Gaskell&rsquo;s descriptions in the 
beginning of her book would seem to suggest.&nbsp; Between Lancashire and 
Yorkshire there is always a suspicion of jealousy.&nbsp; It was intensified
for the moment by these sombre pictures of &lsquo;this lawless, yet not 
unkindly population.&rsquo; <a name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17" 
class="citation">[17]</a>&nbsp; A son-in-law of Mr. Redhead wrote to deny 
the account of that clergyman&rsquo;s association with Haworth.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;He gives another as true, in which I don&rsquo;t see any great 
difference.&rsquo;&nbsp; Miss Martineau wrote sheet after sheet explanatory
of her relations with Charlotte Bront&euml;.&nbsp; &lsquo;Two separate 
householders in London <i>each</i> declares that the first interview 
between Miss Bront&euml; and Miss Martineau took place at <i>her</i> 
house.&rsquo;&nbsp; In one passage Mrs. Gaskell had spoken of wasteful 
young servants, and the young servants in question came upon Mr. 
Bront&euml; for the following testimonial:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, <i>August</i> 17<i>th</i>, 
1857.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg leave to state to all whom it may concern, that Nancy and 
Sarah Garrs, during the time they were in my service, were kind to my 
children, and honest, and not wasteful, but <!-- page 18--><a 
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>sufficiently careful in
regard to food, and all other articles committed to their charge.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">P. Bront&euml;</span>, 
<span class="smcap">A.B.</span>,<br />
&lsquo;<i>Incumbent of Haworth</i>, <i>Yorkshire</i>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three whole pages were devoted to the dramatic recital of a scandal at 
Haworth, and this entirely disappears from the third edition.&nbsp; A 
casual reference to a girl who had been seduced, and had found a friend in 
Miss Bront&euml;, gave further trouble.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have altered the 
word &ldquo;seduced&rdquo; to &ldquo;betrayed,&rdquo;&rsquo; writes Mrs. 
Gaskell to Martha Brown, &lsquo;and I hope that this will satisfy the 
unhappy girl&rsquo;s friends.&rsquo;&nbsp; But all these were small matters
compared with the Cowan Bridge controversy and the threatened legal 
proceedings over Branwell Bront&euml;&rsquo;s suggested love affairs.&nbsp;
Mrs. Gaskell defended the description in <i>Jane Eyre</i> of Cowan Bridge 
with peculiar vigour.&nbsp; Mr. Carus Wilson, the Brocklehurst of <i>Jane 
Eyre</i>, and his friends were furious.&nbsp; They threatened an 
action.&nbsp; There were letters in the <i>Times</i> and letters in the 
<i>Daily News</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Nicholls broke silence&mdash;the only time in 
the forty years that he has done so&mdash;with two admirable letters to the
<i>Halifax Guardian</i>.&nbsp; The Cowan Bridge controversy was a drawn 
battle, in spite of numerous and glowing testimonials to the virtues of Mr.
Carus Wilson.&nbsp; Most people who know anything of the average private 
schools of half a century ago are satisfied that Charlotte 
Bront&euml;&rsquo;s description was substantially correct.&nbsp; &lsquo;I 
want to show you many letters,&rsquo; writes Mrs. Gaskell, &lsquo;most of 
them praising the character of our dear friend as she deserves, and from 
people whose opinion she would have cared for, such as the Duke of Argyll, 
Kingsley, Greig, etc.&nbsp; Many abusing me.&nbsp; I should think seven or 
eight of this kind from the Carus Wilson clique.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Branwell matter was more serious.&nbsp; Here Mrs. Gaskell had, 
indeed, shown a singular recklessness.&nbsp; The lady referred to by 
Branwell was Mrs. Robinson, the wife of the Rev. Edmund Robinson of Thorp 
Green, and afterwards Lady <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Scott.&nbsp; Anne Bront&euml; was governess in 
her family for two years, and Branwell tutor to the son for a few 
months.&nbsp; Branwell, under the influence of opium, made certain 
statements about his relations with Mrs. Robinson which have been 
effectually disproved, although they were implicitly believed by the 
Bront&euml; girls, who, womanlike, were naturally ready to regard a woman 
as the ruin of a beloved brother.&nbsp; The recklessness of Mrs. Gaskell in
accepting such inadequate testimony can be explained only on the assumption
that she had a novelist&rsquo;s satisfaction in the romance which the 
&lsquo;bad woman&rsquo; theory supplied.&nbsp; She wasted a considerable 
amount of rhetoric upon it.&nbsp; &lsquo;When the fatal attack came 
on,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;his pockets were found filled with old letters 
from the woman to whom he was attached.&nbsp; He died! she lives 
still&mdash;in May Fair.&nbsp; I see her name in county papers, as one of 
those who patronise the Christmas balls; and I hear of her in London 
drawing-rooms&rsquo;&mdash;and so on.&nbsp; There were no love-letters 
found in Branwell Bront&euml;&rsquo;s pockets. <a name="citation19"></a><a 
href="#footnote19" class="citation">[19]</a>&nbsp; When Mrs. 
Gaskell&rsquo;s husband came post-haste to Haworth to ask for proofs of 
Mrs. Robinson&rsquo;s complicity in Branwell&rsquo;s downfall, none were 
obtainable.&nbsp; I am assured by Mr. Leslie Stephen that his father, Sir 
James Stephen, was employed at the time to make careful inquiry, and that 
he and other eminent lawyers came to the conclusion that it was one long 
tissue of lies or hallucinations.&nbsp; The subject is sufficiently sordid,
and indeed almost redundant in any biography of the Bront&euml;s; but it is
of moment, because Charlotte Bront&euml; and her sisters were so thoroughly
persuaded that a woman was at the bottom of their brother&rsquo;s ruin; and
this belief Charlotte impressed upon all the friends who were nearest and 
dearest to her.&nbsp; Her letters at the time of her brother&rsquo;s <!-- 
page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>death are 
full of censure of the supposed wickedness of another.&nbsp; It was a cruel
infamy that the word of this wretched boy should have been so powerful for 
mischief.&nbsp; Here, at any rate, Mrs. Gaskell did not show the caution 
which a masculine biographer, less prone to take literally a man&rsquo;s 
accounts of his amours, would undoubtedly have displayed.</p>
<p>Yet, when all is said, Mrs. Gaskell had done her work thoroughly and 
well.&nbsp; Lockhart&rsquo;s <i>Scott</i> and Froude&rsquo;s <i>Carlyle</i>
are examples of great biographies which called for abundant censure upon 
their publication; yet both these books will live as classics of their 
kind.&nbsp; To be interesting, it is perhaps indispensable that the 
biographer should be indiscreet, and certainly the Branwell 
incident&mdash;a matter of two or three pages&mdash;is the only part of 
Mrs. Gaskell&rsquo;s biography in which indiscretion becomes 
indefensible.&nbsp; And for this she suffered cruelly.&nbsp; &lsquo;I did 
so try to tell the truth,&rsquo; she said to a friend, &lsquo;and I believe
<i>now</i> I hit as near to the truth as any one could do.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I weighed every line with my whole power and heart,&rsquo; she said 
on another occasion, &lsquo;so that every line should go to its great 
purpose of making <i>her</i> known and valued, as one who had gone through 
such a terrible life with a brave and faithful heart.&rsquo;&nbsp; And that
clearly Mrs. Gaskell succeeded in doing.&nbsp; It is quite certain that 
Charlotte Bront&euml; would not stand on so splendid a pedestal to-day but 
for the single-minded devotion of her accomplished biographer.</p>
<p>It has sometimes been implied that the portrait drawn by Mrs. Gaskell 
was far too sombre, that there are passages in Charlotte&rsquo;s letters 
which show that ofttimes her heart was merry and her life sufficiently 
cheerful.&nbsp; That there were long periods of gaiety for all the three 
sisters, surely no one ever doubted.&nbsp; To few people, fortunately, is 
it given to have lives wholly without happiness.&nbsp; And yet, when this 
is acknowledged, how can one say that the <!-- page 21--><a 
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>picture was too 
gloomy?&nbsp; Taken as a whole, the life of Charlotte Bront&euml; was among
the saddest in literature.&nbsp; At a miserable school, where she herself 
was unhappy, she saw her two elder sisters stricken down and carried home 
to die.&nbsp; In her home was the narrowest poverty.&nbsp; She had, in the 
years when that was most essential, no mother&rsquo;s care; and perhaps 
there was a somewhat too rigid disciplinarian in the aunt who took the 
mother&rsquo;s place.&nbsp; Her second school brought her, indeed, two kind
friends; but her shyness made that school-life in itself a prolonged 
tragedy.&nbsp; Of the two experiences as a private governess I shall have 
more to say.&nbsp; They were periods of torture to her sensitive 
nature.&nbsp; The ambition of the three girls to start a school on their 
own account failed ignominiously.&nbsp; The suppressed vitality of 
childhood and early womanhood made Charlotte unable to enter with sympathy 
and toleration into the life of a foreign city, and Brussels was for her a 
further disaster.&nbsp; Then within two years, just as literary fame was 
bringing its consolation for the trials of the past, she saw her two 
beloved sisters taken from her.&nbsp; And, finally, when at last a good man
won her love, there were left to her only nine months of happy married 
life.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am not going to die.&nbsp; We have been so 
happy.&rsquo;&nbsp; These words to her husband on her death-bed are not the
least piteously sad in her tragic story.&nbsp; That her life was a tragedy,
was the opinion of the woman friend with whom on the intellectual side she 
had most in common.&nbsp; Miss Mary Taylor wrote to Mrs. Gaskell the 
following letter from New Zealand upon receipt of the 
<i>Life</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, 
30<i>th</i> <i>July</i> 1857.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Gaskell</span>,&mdash;I am 
unaccountably in receipt by post of two vols. containing the Life of C. 
Bront&euml;.&nbsp; I have pleasure in attributing this compliment to you; I
beg, therefore, to thank you for them.&nbsp; The book is a perfect success,
in giving a true picture of a melancholy life, and you have <!-- page 
22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>practically 
answered my puzzle as to how you would give an account of her, not being at
liberty to give a true description of those around.&nbsp; Though not so 
gloomy as the truth, it is perhaps as much so as people will accept without
calling it exaggerated, and feeling the desire to doubt and contradict 
it.&nbsp; I have seen two reviews of it.&nbsp; One of them sums it up as 
&ldquo;a life of poverty and self-suppression,&rdquo; the other has nothing
to the purpose at all.&nbsp; Neither of them seems to think it a strange or
wrong state of things that a woman of first-rate talents, industry, and 
integrity should live all her life in a walking nightmare of &ldquo;poverty
and self-suppression.&rdquo;&nbsp; I doubt whether any of them will.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It must upset most people&rsquo;s notions of beauty to be told 
that the portrait at the beginning is that of an ugly woman. <a 
name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22" class="citation">[22]</a>&nbsp;
I do not altogether like the idea of publishing a flattered likeness.&nbsp;
I had rather the mouth and eyes had been nearer together, and shown the 
veritable square face and large disproportionate nose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had the impression that Cartwright&rsquo;s mill was burnt in 
1820 not in 1812.&nbsp; You give much too favourable an account of the 
black-coated and Tory savages that kept the people down, and provoked 
excesses in those days.&nbsp; Old Robertson said he &ldquo;would wade to 
the knees in blood rather than the then state of things should be 
altered,&rdquo;&mdash;a state including Corn law, Test law, and a host of 
other oppressions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Once more I thank you for the book&mdash;the first copy, I 
believe, that arrived in New Zealand.&mdash;Sincerely yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Mary 
Taylor</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in another letter, written a little later (28th January 1858), Miss 
Mary Taylor writes to Miss Ellen Nussey in similar strain:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Your account of Mrs. Gaskell&rsquo;s book was very 
interesting,&rsquo; she says.&nbsp; &lsquo;She seems a hasty, impulsive 
person, and the <!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>needful drawing back after her warmth gives her
an inconsistent look.&nbsp; Yet I doubt not her book will be of great 
use.&nbsp; You must be aware that many strange notions as to the kind of 
person Charlotte really was will be done away with by a knowledge of the 
true facts of her life.&nbsp; I have heard imperfectly of farther printing 
on the subject.&nbsp; As to the mutilated edition that is to come, I am 
sorry for it.&nbsp; Libellous or not, the first edition was all true, and 
except the declamation all, in my opinion, useful to be published.&nbsp; Of
course I don&rsquo;t know how far necessity may make Mrs. Gaskell give them
up.&nbsp; You know one dare not always say the world moves.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We who do know the whole story in fullest detail will understand that it
was desirable to &lsquo;mutilate&rsquo; the book, and that, indeed, truth 
did in some measure require it.&nbsp; But with these letters of Mary 
Taylor&rsquo;s before us, let us not hear again that the story of Charlotte
Bront&euml;&rsquo;s life was not, in its main features, accurately and 
adequately told by her gifted biographer.</p>
<p>Why then, I am naturally asked, add one further book to the Bront&euml; 
biographical literature?&nbsp; The reply is, I hope, sufficient.&nbsp; 
Forty years have gone by, and they have been years of growing interest in 
the subject.&nbsp; In the year 1895 ten thousand people visited the 
Bront&euml; Museum at Haworth.&nbsp; Interesting books have been written, 
notably Sir Wemyss Reid&rsquo;s <i>Monograph</i> and Mr. Leyland&rsquo;s 
<i>Bront&euml; Family</i>, but they have gone out of print.&nbsp; Many new 
facts have come to light, and many details, moreover, which were too 
trivial in 1857 are of sufficient importance to-day; and many facts which 
were rightly suppressed then may honestly and honourably be given to the 
public at an interval of nearly half a century.&nbsp; Added to all this, 
fortune has been kind to me.</p>
<p>Some three or four years ago Miss Ellen Nussey placed in my hands a 
printed volume of some 400 pages, which bore no publisher&rsquo;s name, but
contained upon its title-page the statement that it was <i>The Story of 
Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s Life</i>, <!-- page 24--><a 
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span><i>as told through her 
Letters</i>.&nbsp; These are the Letters&mdash;370 in number&mdash;which 
Miss Nussey had lent to Mrs. Gaskell and to Sir Wemyss Reid.&nbsp; Of these
letters Mrs. Gaskell published about 100, and Sir Wemyss Reid added as many
more as he considered circumstances justified twenty years back.</p>
<p>It was explained to me that the volume had been privately printed under 
a misconception, and that only some dozen copies were extant.&nbsp; Miss 
Nussey asked me if I would write something around what might remain of the 
unpublished letters, and if I saw my way to do anything which would add to 
the public appreciation of the friend who from early childhood until now 
has been the most absorbing interest of her life.&nbsp; A careful study of 
the volume made it perfectly clear that there were still some letters which
might with advantage be added to the Bront&euml; story.&nbsp; At the same 
time arose the possibility of a veto being placed upon their 
publication.&nbsp; An examination of Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s will, 
which was proved at York by her husband in 1855, suggested an easy way out 
of the difficulty.&nbsp; I made up my mind to try and see Mr. 
Nicholls.&nbsp; I had heard of his disinclination to be in any way 
associated with the controversy which had gathered round his wife for all 
these years; but I wrote to him nevertheless, and received a cordial 
invitation to visit him in his Irish home.</p>
<p>It was exactly forty years to a day after Charlotte died&mdash;March 
31st, 1895&mdash;when I alighted at the station in a quiet little town in 
the centre of Ireland, to receive the cordial handclasp of the man into 
whose keeping Charlotte Bront&euml; had given her life.&nbsp; It was one of
many visits, and the beginning of an interesting correspondence.&nbsp; Mr. 
Nicholls placed all the papers in his possession in my hands.&nbsp; They 
were more varied and more abundant than I could possibly have 
anticipated.&nbsp; They included MSS. of childhood, of which so much has 
been said, and stories of adult life, one fragment indeed being later than 
the <i>Emma</i> which <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>appeared in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> for 
1856, with a note by Thackeray.&nbsp; Here were the letters Charlotte 
Bront&euml; had written to her brother and to her sisters during her second
sojourn in Brussels&mdash;to &lsquo;Dear Branwell&rsquo; and &lsquo;Dear E.
J.,&rsquo; as she calls Emily&mdash;letters even to handle will give a 
thrill to the Bront&euml; enthusiast.&nbsp; Here also were the love-letters
of Maria Branwell to her lover Patrick Bront&euml;, which are referred to 
in Mrs. Gaskell&rsquo;s biography, but have never hitherto been 
printed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;The four small scraps of Emily and Anne&rsquo;s 
manuscript,&rsquo; writes Mr. Nicholls, &lsquo;I found in the small box I 
send you; the others I found in the bottom of a cupboard tied up in a 
newspaper, where they had lain for nearly thirty years, and where, had it 
not been for your visit, they must have remained during my lifetime, and 
most likely afterwards have been destroyed.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some slight extracts from Bront&euml; letters in <i>Macmillan&rsquo;s 
Magazine</i>, signed &lsquo;E. Balmer Williams,&rsquo; brought me into 
communication with a gifted daughter of Mr. W. S. Williams.&nbsp; Mrs. 
Williams and her husband generously placed the whole series of these 
letters of Charlotte Bront&euml; to their father at my disposal.&nbsp; It 
was of some of these letters that Mrs. Gaskell wrote in enthusiastic terms 
when she had read them, and she was only permitted to see a few.&nbsp; Then
I have to thank Mr. Joshua Taylor, the nephew of Miss Mary Taylor, for 
permission to publish his aunt&rsquo;s letters.&nbsp; Mr. James Taylor, 
again, who wanted to marry Charlotte Bront&euml;, and who died twenty years
afterwards in Bombay, left behind him a bundle of letters which I found in 
the possession of a relative in the north of London. <a 
name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25" class="citation">[25]</a>&nbsp;
I discovered through a letter addressed to Miss Nussey that the 
&lsquo;Brussels friend&rsquo; referred to by Mrs. Gaskell was a Miss 
L&aelig;titia Wheelwright, and I determined to write to all the <!-- page 
26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>Wheelwrights in
the London Directory.&nbsp; My first effort succeeded, and <i>the</i> Miss 
Wheelwright kindly lent me all the letters that she had preserved.&nbsp; It
is scarcely possible that time will reveal many more unpublished letters 
from the author of <i>Jane Eyre</i>.&nbsp; Several of those already in 
print are forgeries, and I have actually seen a letter addressed from 
Paris, a city which Miss Bront&euml; never visited.&nbsp; I have the 
assurance of Dr. H&eacute;ger of Brussels that Miss Bront&euml;&rsquo;s 
correspondence with his father no longer exists.&nbsp; In any case one may 
safely send forth this little book with the certainty that it is a fairly 
complete collection of Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s correspondence, and 
that it is altogether a valuable revelation of a singularly interesting 
personality.&nbsp; Steps will be taken henceforth, it may be added, to 
vindicate Mr. Nicholls&rsquo;s rights in whatever may still remain of his 
wife&rsquo;s unpublished correspondence.</p>
<h2><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
27</span>CHAPTER I: PATRICK BRONT&Euml; AND MARIA HIS WIFE</h2>
<p>It would seem quite clear to any careful investigator that the Reverend 
Patrick Bront&euml;, Incumbent of Haworth, and the father of three famous 
daughters, was a much maligned man.&nbsp; We talk of the fierce light which
beats upon a throne, but what is that compared to the fierce light which 
beats upon any man of some measure of individuality who is destined to live
out his life in the quiet of a country village&mdash;in the very centre, as
it were, of &lsquo;personal talk&rsquo; and gossip not always kindly to the
stranger within the gate?&nbsp; The view of Mr. Bront&euml;, presented by 
Mrs. Gaskell in the early editions of her biography of Charlotte 
Bront&euml;, is that of a severe, ill-tempered, and distinctly disagreeable
character.&nbsp; It is the picture of a man who disliked the vanities of 
life so intensely, that the new shoes of his children and the silk dress of
his wife were not spared by him in sudden gusts of passion.&nbsp; A stern 
old ruffian, one is inclined to consider him.&nbsp; His pistol-shooting 
rings picturesquely, but not agreeably, through Mrs. Gaskell&rsquo;s 
memoirs.&nbsp; It has been already explained in more than one quarter that 
this was not the real Patrick Bront&euml;, and that much of the 
unfavourable gossip was due to the chatter of a dismissed servant, retailed
to Mrs. Gaskell on one of her missions of inquiry in the 
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The stories of the burnt shoes and the mutilated dress
have been relegated to the realm of myth, and the pistol-shooting may now 
be acknowledged <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>as a harmless pastime not more iniquitous than 
the golfing or angling of a latter-day clergyman.&nbsp; It is certain, were
the matter of much interest to-day, that Mr. Bront&euml; was fond of the 
use of firearms.&nbsp; The present Incumbent of Haworth will point out to 
you, on the old tower of Haworth Church, the marks of pistol bullets, which
he is assured were made by Mr. Bront&euml;.&nbsp; I have myself handled 
both the gun and the pistol&mdash;this latter a very ornamental weapon, by 
the way, manufactured at Bradford&mdash;which Mr. Bront&euml; possessed 
during the later years of his life.&nbsp; From both he had obtained much 
innocent amusement; but his son-in-law, Mr. Nicholls, who, at the distance 
of forty years still cherishes a reverent and enthusiastic affection for 
old Mr. Bront&euml;, informs me that the bullet marks upon Haworth Church 
were the irresponsible frolic of a rather juvenile curate&mdash;Mr. 
Smith.&nbsp; All this is trivial enough in any case, and one turns very 
readily to more important factors in the life of the father of the 
Bront&euml;s.&nbsp; Patrick Bront&euml; was born at Ahaderg, County Down, 
in Ireland, on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, March 17, 1777.&nbsp; He was one of
the ten children of Hugh Brunty, farmer, and his nine brothers and sisters 
seem all of them to have spent their lives in their Irish home, to have 
married and been given in marriage, and to have gone to their graves in 
peace.&nbsp; Patrick alone had ambition, and, one must add, the opportune 
friend, without whom ambition counts for little in the great struggle of 
life.&nbsp; At sixteen he was a kind of village schoolmaster, or assistant 
schoolmaster, and at twenty-five, stirred thereto by the vicar of his 
parish, Mr. Tighe, he was on his way from Ireland to St. John&rsquo;s 
College, Cambridge.&nbsp; It was in 1802 that Patrick Bront&euml; went to 
Cambridge, and entered his name in the college books.&nbsp; There, indeed, 
we find the name, not of Patrick Bront&euml;, but of Patrick Branty, <a 
name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28" class="citation">[28]</a> and 
this brings us to an <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>interesting point as to the origin of the 
name.&nbsp; In the register of his birth his name is entered, as are the 
births of his brothers and sisters, as &lsquo;Brunty&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;Bruntee&rsquo;; and it can scarcely be doubted that, as Dr. Douglas 
Hyde has pointed out, the original name was O&rsquo;Prunty. <a 
name="citation29"></a><a href="#footnote29" class="citation">[29]</a>&nbsp;
The Irish, at the beginning of the century, were well-nigh as primitive in 
some matters as were the English of a century earlier; and one is not 
surprised to see variations in the spelling of the Bront&euml; 
name&mdash;it being in the case of his brothers and sisters occasionally 
spelt &lsquo;Brontee.&rsquo;&nbsp; To me it is perfectly clear that for the
change of name Lord Nelson was responsible, and that the dukedom of 
Bront&euml;, which was conferred upon the great sailor in 1799, suggested 
the more ornamental surname.&nbsp; There were no Irish Bront&euml;s in 
existence before Nelson became Duke of Bront&euml;; but all Patrick&rsquo;s
brothers and sisters, with whom, it must be remembered, he was on terms of 
correspondence his whole life long, gradually, with a true Celtic sense of 
the picturesqueness of the thing, seized upon the more attractive 
surname.&nbsp; For this theory there is, of course, not one scrap of 
evidence; we only know that the register of Patrick&rsquo;s native parish 
gives us Brunty, and that his signature through his successive curacies is 
Bront&euml;.</p>
<p>From Cambridge, after taking orders in 1806, Mr. Bront&euml; moved to a 
curacy at Weatherfield in Essex; and Mr. Augustine Birrell has told us, 
with that singular literary charm of his, how the good-looking Irish curate
made successful love to a young parishioner&mdash;Miss Mary Burder.&nbsp; 
<!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Mary 
Burder would have married him, it seems, but for an obdurate uncle and 
guardian.&nbsp; She was spirited away from the neighbourhood, and the 
lovers never met again.&nbsp; There are doubtful points in Mr. 
Birrell&rsquo;s story.&nbsp; Mary Burder, as the wife of a Nonconformist 
minister, died in 1866, in her seventy-seventh year.&nbsp; This lady, from 
whom doubtless either directly or indirectly the tradition was obtained, 
may have amplified and exaggerated a very innocent flirtation.&nbsp; One 
would like further evidence for the statement that when Mr. Bront&euml; 
lost his wife in 1821 he asked his old sweetheart, Mary Burder, to become 
the mother of his six children, and that she answered 
&lsquo;no&rsquo;.&nbsp; In any case, Mr. Bront&euml; left Weatherfield in 
1809 for a curacy at Dewsbury, and Dewsbury gossip also had much to say 
concerning the flirtations of its Irish curate.&nbsp; His next curacy, 
however, which was obtained in 1811, by a removal to Hartshead, near 
Huddersfield, brought flirtation for Mr. Bront&euml; to a speedy end.&nbsp;
In 1812, when thirty-three years of age, he married Miss Maria Branwell, of
Penzance.&nbsp; Miss Branwell had only a few months before left her Cornish
home for a visit to an uncle in Yorkshire.&nbsp; This uncle was a Mr. John 
Fennell, a clergyman of the Church of England, who had been a Methodist 
minister.&nbsp; To Methodism, indeed, the Cornish Branwells would seem to 
have been devoted at one time or another, for I have seen a copy of the 
<i>Imitation</i> inscribed &lsquo;M. Branwell, July 1807,&rsquo; with the 
following title-page:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
31</span>The book was evidently brought by Mrs. Bront&euml; from Penzance, 
and given by her to her husband or left among her effects.&nbsp; The poor 
little woman had been in her grave for five or six years when it came into 
the hands of one of her daughters, as we learn from Charlotte&rsquo;s 
hand-writing on the fly-leaf:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;<i>C. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s book</i>.&nbsp; <i>This book was given 
to me in July 1826</i>.&nbsp; <i>It is not certainly known who is the 
author</i>, <i>but it is generally supposed that Thomas &agrave; Kempis 
is</i>.&nbsp; <i>I saw a reward of</i> &pound;10,000 <i>offered in the 
Leeds Mercury to any one who could find out for a certainty who is the 
author</i>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conjunction of the names of John Wesley, Maria Branwell, and 
Charlotte Bront&euml; surely gives this little volume, &lsquo;price bound 
1s.,&rsquo; a singular interest!</p>
<p>But here I must refer to the letters which Maria Branwell wrote to her 
lover during the brief courtship.&nbsp; Mrs. Gaskell, it will be 
remembered, makes but one extract from this correspondence, which was 
handed to her by Mr. Bront&euml; as part of the material for her 
memoir.&nbsp; Long years before, the little packet had been taken from Mr. 
Bront&euml;&rsquo;s desk, for we find Charlotte writing to a friend on 
February 16th, 1850:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;A few days since, a little incident happened which curiously 
touched me.&nbsp; Papa put into my hands a little packet of letters and 
papers, telling me that they were mamma&rsquo;s, and that I might read 
them.&nbsp; I did read them, in a frame of mind I cannot describe.&nbsp; 
The papers were yellow with time, all having been written before I was 
born.&nbsp; It was strange now to peruse, for the first time, the records 
of a mind whence my own sprang; and most strange, and at once sad and 
sweet, to find that mind of a truly fine, pure, and elevated order.&nbsp; 
They were written to papa before they were married.&nbsp; There is a 
rectitude, a refinement, a constancy, a modesty, a sense, a gentleness 
about them indescribable.&nbsp; I wish she had lived, and that I had known 
her.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
32</span>Yet another forty years or so and the little packet is in my 
possession.&nbsp; Handling, with a full sense of their sacredness, these 
letters, written more than eighty years ago by a good woman to her lover, 
one is tempted to hope that there is no breach of the privacy which should,
even in our day, guide certain sides of life, in publishing the 
correspondence in its completeness.&nbsp; With the letters I find a little 
MS., which is also of pathetic interest.&nbsp; It is entitled &lsquo;The 
Advantages of Poverty in Religious Concerns,&rsquo; and it is endorsed in 
the handwriting of Mr. Bront&euml;, written, doubtless, many years 
afterwards:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;<i>The above was written by my dear wife</i>, <i>and is for 
insertion in one of the periodical publications</i>.&nbsp; <i>Keep it as a 
memorial of her</i>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no reason to suppose that the MS. was ever published; there is 
no reason why any editor should have wished to publish it.&nbsp; It abounds
in the obvious.&nbsp; At the same time, one notes that from both father and
mother alike Charlotte Bront&euml; and her sisters inherited some measure 
of the literary faculty.&nbsp; It is nothing to say that not one line of 
the father&rsquo;s or mother&rsquo;s would have been preserved had it not 
been for their gifted children.&nbsp; It is sufficient that the zest for 
writing was there, and that the intense passion for handling a pen, which 
seems to have been singularly strong in Charlotte Bront&euml;, must have 
come to a great extent from a similar passion alike in father and 
mother.&nbsp; Mr. Bront&euml;, indeed, may be counted a prolific 
author.&nbsp; He published, in all, four books, three pamphlets, and two 
sermons.&nbsp; Of his books, two were in verse and two in prose.&nbsp; 
<i>Cottage Poems</i> was published in 1811; <i>The Rural Minstrel</i> in 
1812, the year of his marriage; <i>The Cottage in the Wood</i> in 1815; and
<i>The Maid of Killarney</i> in 1818.&nbsp; After his wife&rsquo;s death he
published no more books.&nbsp; Reading over these old-fashioned volumes 
now, one admits that they possess but little distinction.&nbsp; It has been
pointed out, indeed, that <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>one of the strongest lines in <i>Jane 
Eyre</i>&mdash;&lsquo;To the finest fibre of my nature, 
sir.&rsquo;&mdash;is culled from Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s verse.&nbsp; It is
the one line of his that will live.&nbsp; Like his daughter Charlotte, Mr. 
Bront&euml; is more interesting in his prose than in his poetry.&nbsp; 
<i>The Cottage in the Wood</i>; <i>or</i>, <i>the Art of Becoming Rich and 
Happy</i>, is a kind of religious novel&mdash;a spiritual <i>Pamela</i>, in
which the reprobate pursuer of an innocent girl ultimately becomes 
converted and marries her.&nbsp; <i>The Maid of Killarney</i>; <i>or</i>, 
<i>Albion and Flora</i> is more interesting.&nbsp; Under the guise of a 
story it has something to say on many questions of importance.&nbsp; We 
know now why Charlotte never learnt to dance until she went to Brussels, 
and why children&rsquo;s games were unknown to her, for here are many mild 
diatribes against dancing and card-playing.&nbsp; The British Constitution 
and the British and Foreign Bible Society receive a considerable amount of 
criticism.&nbsp; But in spite of this didactic weakness there are one or 
two pieces of really picturesque writing, notably a description of an Irish
wake, and a forcible account of the defence of a house against some 
Whiteboys.&nbsp; It is true enough that the books are merely of interest to
collectors and that they live only by virtue of Patrick Bront&euml;&rsquo;s
remarkable children.&nbsp; But many a prolific writer of the day passes 
muster as a genius among his contemporaries upon as small a talent; and Mr.
Bront&euml; does not seem to have given himself any airs as an 
author.&nbsp; Thirty years were to elapse before there were to be any more 
books from this family of writers; but <i>Jane Eyre</i> owes something, we 
may be sure, to <i>The Maid of Killarney</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Bront&euml;, as I have said, married Maria Branwell in 1812.&nbsp; 
She was in her twenty-ninth year, and was one of five children&mdash;one 
son and four daughters&mdash;the father of whom, Mr. Thomas Branwell, had 
died in 1809.&nbsp; By a curious coincidence, another sister, Charlotte, 
was married in Penzance on the same day&mdash;the 18th of December 1812. <a
name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33" class="citation">[33]</a>&nbsp;
<!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
34</span>Before me are a bundle of samplers, worked by three of these 
Branwell sisters.&nbsp; Maria Branwell &lsquo;ended her sampler&rsquo; 
April the 15th, 1791, and it is inscribed with the text, <i>Flee from sin 
as from a serpent</i>, <i>for if thou comest too near to it</i>, <i>it will
bite thee</i>.&nbsp; <i>The teeth thereof are as the teeth of a lion to 
slay the souls of men</i>.&nbsp; Another sampler is by Elizabeth Branwell; 
another by Margaret, and another by Anne.&nbsp; These, some miniatures, and
the book and papers to which I have referred, are all that remain to us as 
a memento of Mrs. Bront&euml;, apart from the children that she bore to her
husband.&nbsp; The miniatures, which are in the possession of Miss 
Branwell, of Penzance, are of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Branwell&mdash;Charlotte 
Bront&euml;&rsquo;s maternal grandfather and grandmother&mdash;and of Mrs. 
Bront&euml; and her sister Elizabeth Branwell as children.</p>
<p>To return, however, to our bundle of love-letters.&nbsp; Comment is 
needless, if indeed comment or elucidation were possible at this distance 
of time.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Wood House 
Grove</span>, <i>August</i> 26<i>th</i>, 1812.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;This address is 
sufficient to convince you <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>that I not only permit, but approve of yours to
me&mdash;I do indeed consider you as my <i>friend</i>; yet, when I consider
how short a time I have had the pleasure of knowing you, I start at my own 
rashness, my heart fails, and did I not think that you would be 
disappointed and grieved at it, I believe I should be ready to spare myself
the task of writing.&nbsp; Do not think that I am so wavering as to repent 
of what I have already said.&nbsp; No, believe me, this will never be the 
case, unless you give me cause for it.&nbsp; You need not fear that you 
have been mistaken in my character.&nbsp; If I know anything of myself, I 
am incapable of making an ungenerous return to the smallest degree of 
kindness, much less to you whose attentions and conduct have been so 
particularly obliging.&nbsp; I will frankly confess that your behaviour and
what I have seen and heard of your character has excited my warmest esteem 
and regard, and be assured you shall never have cause to repent of any 
confidence you may think proper to place in me, and that it will always be 
my endeavour to deserve the good opinion which you have formed, although 
human weakness may in some instances cause me to fall short.&nbsp; In 
giving you these assurances I do not depend upon my own strength, but I 
look to Him who has been my unerring guide through life, and in whose 
continued protection and assistance I confidently trust.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought on you much on Sunday, and feared you would not escape 
the rain.&nbsp; I hope you do not feel any bad effects from it?&nbsp; My 
cousin wrote you on Monday and expects this afternoon to be favoured with 
an answer.&nbsp; Your letter has caused me some foolish embarrassment, 
tho&rsquo; in pity to my feelings they have been very sparing of their 
raillery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will now candidly answer your questions.&nbsp; The 
<i>politeness of others</i> can never make me forget your kind attentions, 
neither can I <i>walk our accustomed rounds</i> without thinking on you, 
and, why should I be ashamed to add, wishing for your presence.&nbsp; If 
you knew what were my feelings whilst writing this you would pity me.&nbsp;
I wish to write the truth and give you satisfaction, yet fear to go too 
far, and exceed the bounds of propriety.&nbsp; But whatever I may say or 
write I will <i>never deceive</i> you, or <i>exceed the truth</i>.&nbsp; If
you think I have not placed the <i>utmost confidence</i> in <!-- page 
36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>you, consider 
my situation, and ask yourself if I have not confided in you sufficiently, 
perhaps too much.&nbsp; I am very sorry that you will not have this till 
after to-morrow, but it was out of my power to write sooner.&nbsp; I rely 
on your goodness to pardon everything in this which may appear either too 
free or too stiff; and beg that you will consider me as a warm and faithful
friend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My uncle, aunt, and cousin unite in kind regards.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must now conclude with again declaring myself to be yours 
sincerely,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Friend</span>,&mdash;I have just received
your affectionate and very welcome letter, and although I shall not be able
to send this until Monday, yet I cannot deny myself the pleasure of writing
a few lines this evening, no longer considering it a task, but a pleasure, 
next to that of reading yours.&nbsp; I had the pleasure of hearing from Mr.
Fennell, who was at Bradford on Thursday afternoon, that you had rested 
there all night.&nbsp; Had you proceeded, I am sure the walk would have 
been too much for you; such excessive fatigue, often repeated, must injure 
the strongest constitution.&nbsp; I am rejoiced to find that our 
forebodings were without cause.&nbsp; I had yesterday a letter from a very 
dear friend of mine, and had the satisfaction to learn by it that all at 
home are well.&nbsp; I feel with you the unspeakable obligations I am under
to a merciful Providence&mdash;my heart swells with gratitude, and I feel 
an earnest desire that I may be enabled to make some suitable return to the
Author of all my blessings.&nbsp; In general, I think I am enabled to cast 
my care upon Him, and then I experience a calm and peaceful serenity of 
mind which few things can destroy.&nbsp; In all my addresses to the throne 
of grace I never ask a blessing for myself but I beg the same for you, and 
considering the important station which you are called to fill, my prayers 
are proportionately fervent that you may be favoured with all the gifts and
graces requisite for such calling.&nbsp; O my dear friend, let us pray much
that we may live lives holy and useful to each other and all around us!</p>
<p><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
37</span>&lsquo;<i>Monday morn</i>.&mdash;My cousin and I were yesterday at
Coverley church, where we heard Mr. Watman preach a very excellent sermon 
from &ldquo;learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly of heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; He 
displayed the character of our Saviour in a most affecting and amiable 
light.&nbsp; I scarcely ever felt more charmed with his excellencies, more 
grateful for his condescension, or more abased at my own unworthiness; but 
I lament that my heart is so little retentive of those pleasing and 
profitable impressions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I pitied you in your solitude, and felt sorry that it was not in 
my power to enliven it.&nbsp; Have you not been too hasty in informing your
friends of a certain event?&nbsp; Why did you not leave them to guess a 
little longer?&nbsp; I shrink from the idea of its being known to every 
body.&nbsp; I do, indeed, <i>sometimes</i> think of you, but I will not say
how often, lest I raise your vanity; and we sometimes talk of you and the 
doctor.&nbsp; But I believe I should seldom mention your name myself were 
it not now and then introduced by my cousin.&nbsp; I have never mentioned a
word of what is past to any body.&nbsp; Had I thought this necessary I 
should have requested you to do it.&nbsp; But I think there is no need, as 
by some means or other they seem to have a pretty correct notion how 
matters stand betwixt us; and as their hints, etc., meet with no 
contradiction from me, my silence passes for confirmation.&nbsp; Mr. 
Fennell has not neglected to give me some serious and encouraging advice, 
and my aunt takes frequent opportunities of dropping little sentences which
I may turn to some advantage.&nbsp; I have long had reason to know that the
present state of things would give pleasure to all parties.&nbsp; Your 
ludicrous account of the scene at the Hermitage was highly diverting, we 
laughed heartily at it; but I fear it will not produce all that compassion 
in Miss Fennell&rsquo;s breast which you seem to wish.&nbsp; I will now 
tell you what I was thinking about and doing at the time you mention.&nbsp;
I was then toiling up the hill with Jane and Mrs. Clapham to take our tea 
at Mr. Tatham&rsquo;s, thinking on the evening when I first took the same 
walk with you, and on the change which had taken place in my circumstances 
and views since then&mdash;not wholly without a wish that I had your arm to
assist me, and your conversation to shorten the walk.&nbsp; Indeed, all our
walks <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
38</span>have now an insipidity in them which I never thought they would 
have possessed.&nbsp; When I work, if I wish to get <i>forward</i> I may be
glad that you are at a distance.&nbsp; Jane begs me to assure you of her 
kind regards.&nbsp; Mr. Morgan is expected to be here this evening.&nbsp; I
must assume a bold and steady countenance to meet his attacks!</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have now written a pretty long letter without reserve or 
caution, and if all the sentiments of my heart are not laid open to you, 
believe me it is not because I wish them to be concealed, for I hope there 
is nothing there that would give you pain or displeasure.&nbsp; My most 
sincere and earnest wishes are for your happiness and welfare, for this 
includes my own.&nbsp; Pray much for me that I may be made a blessing and 
not a hindrance to you.&nbsp; Let me not interrupt your studies nor intrude
on that time which ought to be dedicated to better purposes.&nbsp; Forgive 
my freedom, my dearest friend, and rest assured that you are and ever will 
be dear to</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Maria Branwell</span>.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dearest Friend</span>,&mdash;Having spent 
the day yesterday at Miry Shay, a place near Bradford, I had not got your 
letter till my return in the evening, and consequently have only a short 
time this morning to write if I send it by this post.&nbsp; You surely do 
not think you <i>trouble</i> me by writing?&nbsp; No, I think I may venture
to say if such were your opinion you would <i>trouble</i> me no more.&nbsp;
Be assured, your letters are and I hope always will be received with 
extreme pleasure and read with delight.&nbsp; May our Gracious Father 
mercifully grant the fulfilment of your prayers!&nbsp; Whilst we depend 
entirely on Him for happiness, and receive each other and all our blessings
as from His hands, what can harm us or make us miserable?&nbsp; Nothing 
temporal or spiritual.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jane had a note from Mr. Morgan last evening, and she desires me 
to tell you that the Methodists&rsquo; service in church hours is to 
commence next Sunday week.&nbsp; You may expect frowns and hard words from 
her when you make your appearance here <!-- page 39--><a 
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>again, for, if you 
recollect, she gave you a note to carry to the Doctor, and he has never 
received it.&nbsp; What have you done with it?&nbsp; If you can give a good
account of it you may come to see us as soon as you please and be sure of a
hearty welcome from all parties.&nbsp; Next Wednesday we have some 
thoughts, if the weather be fine, of going to Kirkstall Abbey once more, 
and I suppose your presence will not make the walk less agreeable to any of
us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The old man is come and waits for my letter.&nbsp; In expectation
of seeing you on Monday or Tuesday next,&mdash;I remain, yours faithfully 
and affectionately,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Wood House 
Grove</span>, <i>September</i> 18<i>th</i>, 1812.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How readily do I comply with my dear Mr. B&rsquo;s request!&nbsp;
You see, you have only to express your wishes and as far as my power 
extends I hesitate not to fulfil them.&nbsp; My heart tells me that it will
always be my pride and pleasure to contribute to your happiness, nor do I 
fear that this will ever be inconsistent with my duty as a Christian.&nbsp;
My esteem for you and my confidence in you is so great, that I firmly 
believe you will never exact anything from me which I could not 
conscientiously perform.&nbsp; I shall in future look to you for assistance
and instruction whenever I may need them, and hope you will never withhold 
from me any advice or caution you may see necessary.</p>
<p>[&lsquo;For some years I have been perfectly my own mistress, subject to
no <i>control</i> whatever&mdash;so far from it, that my sisters who are 
many years older than myself, and even my dear mother, used to consult me 
in every case of importance, and scarcely ever doubted the propriety of my 
opinions and actions.&nbsp; Perhaps you will be ready to accuse me of 
vanity in mentioning this, but you must consider that I do not <i>boast</i>
of it, I have many times felt it a disadvantage; and although, I thank God,
it never led me into error, yet in circumstances of perplexity and doubt, I
have deeply felt the want of a guide and instructor.] <a 
name="citation39"></a><a href="#footnote39" class="citation">[39]</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;At such times I have seen and felt the necessity of supernatural 
<!-- page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>aid, 
and by fervent applications to a throne of grace I have experienced that my
heavenly Father is able and willing to supply the place of every earthly 
friend.&nbsp; I shall now no longer feel this want, this sense of helpless 
weakness, for I believe a kind Providence has intended that I shall find in
you every earthly friend united; nor do I fear to trust myself under your 
protection, or shrink from your control.&nbsp; It is pleasant to be subject
to those we love, especially when they never exert their authority but for 
the good of the subject.&nbsp; How few would write in this way!&nbsp; But I
do not fear that <i>you</i> will make a bad use of it.&nbsp; You tell me to
write my thoughts, and thus as they occur I freely let my pen run away with
them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Sat. morn</i>.&mdash;I do not know whether you dare show your 
face here again or not after the blunder you have committed.&nbsp; When we 
got to the house on Thursday evening, even before we were within the doors,
we found that Mr. and Mrs. Bedford had been there, and that they had 
requested you to mention their intention of coming&mdash;a single hint of 
which you never gave!&nbsp; Poor I too came in for a share in the hard 
words which were bestowed upon you, for they all agreed that I was the 
cause of it.&nbsp; Mr. Fennell said you were certainly <i>mazed</i>, and 
talked of sending you to York, etc.&nbsp; And even I begin to think that 
<i>this</i>, together with the <i>note</i>, bears some marks of 
<i>insanity</i>!&nbsp; However, I shall suspend my judgment until I hear 
what excuse you can make for yourself, I suppose you will be quite ready to
make one of some kind or another.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yesterday I performed a difficult and yet a pleasing task in 
writing to my sisters.&nbsp; I thought I never should accomplish the end 
for which the letter was designed; but after a good deal of perambulation I
gave them to understand the nature of my engagement with you, with the 
motives and inducements which led me to form such an engagement, and that 
in consequence of it I should not see them again so soon as I had 
intended.&nbsp; I concluded by expressing a hope that they would not be 
less pleased with the information than were my friends here.&nbsp; I think 
they will not suspect me to have made a wrong step, their partiality for me
is so great.&nbsp; And their affection for me will <!-- page 41--><a 
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>lead them to rejoice in
my welfare, even though it should diminish somewhat of their own.&nbsp; I 
shall think the time tedious till I hear from you, and must beg you will 
write as soon as possible.&nbsp; Pardon me, my dear friend, if I again 
caution you against giving way to a weakness of which I have heard you 
complain.&nbsp; When you find your heart oppressed and your thoughts too 
much engrossed by one subject, let prayer be your refuge&mdash;this you no 
doubt know by experience to be a sure remedy, and a relief from every care 
and error.&nbsp; Oh, that we had more of the spirit of prayer!&nbsp; I feel
that I need it much.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Breakfast-time is near, I must bid you farewell for the time, but
rest assured you will always share in the prayers and heart of your own</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Maria</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Fennell has crossed my letter to my sisters.&nbsp; With his 
usual goodness he has supplied my <i>deficiencies</i>, and spoken of me in 
terms of commendation of which I wish I were more worthy.&nbsp; Your 
character he has likewise displayed in the most favourable light; and I am 
sure they will not fail to love and esteem you though unknown.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All here unite in kind regards.&nbsp; Adieu.&rsquo;</p>

Grove</span>, <i>September</i> 23<i>rd</i>, 1812.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dearest Friend</span>,&mdash;Accept of my 
warmest thanks for your kind affectionate letter, in which you have rated 
mine so highly that I really blush to read my own praises.&nbsp; Pray that 
God would enable me to deserve all the kindness you manifest towards me, 
and to act consistently with the good opinion you entertain of 
me&mdash;then I shall indeed be a helpmeet for you, and to be this shall at
all times be the care and study of my future life.&nbsp; We have had to-day
a large party of the Bradford folks&mdash;the Rands, Fawcets, Dobsons, 
etc.&nbsp; My thoughts often strayed from the company, and I would have 
gladly left them to follow my present employment.&nbsp; To write to and 
receive letters from my friends were always among my chief enjoyments, but 
none ever gave me so much pleasure as those which I receive from and <!-- 
page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>write to 
my newly adopted friend.&nbsp; I am by no means sorry you have given up all
thought of the house you mentioned.&nbsp; With my cousin&rsquo;s help I 
have made known your plans to my uncle and aunt.&nbsp; Mr. Fennell 
immediately coincided with that which respects your present abode, and 
observed that it had occurred to him before, but that he had not had an 
opportunity of mentioning it to you.&nbsp; My aunt did not fall in with it 
so readily, but her objections did not appear to me to be very 
weighty.&nbsp; For my own part, I feel all the force of your arguments in 
favour of it, and the objections are so trifling that they can scarcely be 
called objections.&nbsp; My cousin is of the same opinion.&nbsp; Indeed, 
you have such a method of considering and digesting a plan before you make 
it known to your friends, that you run very little risque of incurring 
their disapprobations, or of having your schemes frustrated.&nbsp; I 
greatly admire your talents this way&mdash;may they never be perverted by 
being used in a bad cause!&nbsp; And whilst they are exerted for good 
purposes, may they prove irresistible!&nbsp; If I may judge from your 
letter, this middle scheme is what would please you best, so that if there 
should arise no new objection to it, perhaps it will prove the best you can
adopt.&nbsp; However, there is yet sufficient time to consider it 
further.&nbsp; I trust in this and every other circumstance you will be 
guided by the wisdom that cometh from above&mdash;a portion of which I 
doubt not has guided you hitherto.&nbsp; A belief of this, added to the 
complete satisfaction with which I read your reasonings on the subject, 
made me a ready convert to your opinions.&nbsp; I hope nothing will occur 
to induce you to change your intention of spending the next week at 
Bradford.&nbsp; Depend on it you shall have letter for letter; but may we 
not hope to see you here during that time, surely you will not think the 
way more tedious than usual?&nbsp; I have not heard any particulars 
respecting the church since you were at Bradford.&nbsp; Mr. Rawson is now 
there, but Mr. Hardy and his brother are absent, and I understand nothing 
decisive can be accomplished without them.&nbsp; Jane expects to hear 
something more to-morrow.&nbsp; Perhaps ere this reaches you, you will have
received some intelligence respecting it from Mr. Morgan.&nbsp; If you have
no other apology to make for your blunders <!-- page 43--><a 
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>than that which you 
have given me, you must not expect to be excused, for I have not mentioned 
it to any one, so that however it may clear your character in my opinion it
is not likely to influence any other person.&nbsp; Little, very little, 
will induce me to cover your faults with a veil of charity.&nbsp; I already
feel a kind of participation in all that concerns you.&nbsp; All praises 
and censures bestowed on you must equally affect me.&nbsp; Your joys and 
sorrows must be mine.&nbsp; Thus shall the one be increased and the other 
diminished.&nbsp; While this is the case we shall, I hope, always find 
&ldquo;life&rsquo;s cares&rdquo; to be &ldquo;comforts.&rdquo;&nbsp; And 
may we feel every trial and distress, for such must be our lot at times, 
bind us nearer to God and to each other!&nbsp; My heart earnestly joins in 
your comprehensive prayers.&nbsp; I trust they will unitedly ascend to a 
throne of grace, and through the Redeemer&rsquo;s merits procure for us 
peace and happiness here and a life of eternal felicity hereafter.&nbsp; 
Oh, what sacred pleasure there is in the idea of spending an eternity 
together in perfect and uninterrupted bliss!&nbsp; This should encourage us
to the utmost exertion and fortitude.&nbsp; But whilst I write, my own 
words condemn me&mdash;I am ashamed of my own indolence and backwardness to
duty.&nbsp; May I be more careful, watchful, and active than I have ever 
yet been!</p>
<p>&lsquo;My uncle, aunt, and Jane request me to send their kind regards, 
and they will be happy to see you any time next week whenever you can 
conveniently come down from Bradford.&nbsp; Let me hear from you 
soon&mdash;I shall expect a letter on Monday.&nbsp; Farewell, my dearest 
friend.&nbsp; That you may be happy in yourself and very useful to all 
around you is the daily earnest prayer of yours truly,</p>

Grove</span>, <i>October</i> 3<i>rd</i>, 1812.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How could my dear friend so cruelly disappoint me?&nbsp; Had he 
known how much I had set my heart on having a letter this afternoon, and 
how greatly I felt the disappointment when the bag arrived and I found 
there was nothing for me, I am sure he would not have permitted a little 
matter to hinder him.&nbsp; But whatever was the reason of your not 
writing, I cannot <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>believe it to have been neglect or unkindness, 
therefore I do not in the least blame you, I only beg that in future you 
will judge of my feelings by your own, and if possible never let me expect 
a letter without receiving one.&nbsp; You know in my last which I sent you 
at Bradford I said it would not be in my power to write the next day, but 
begged I might be favoured with hearing from you on Saturday, and you will 
not wonder that I hoped you would have complied with this request.&nbsp; It
has just occurred to my mind that it is possible this note was not 
received; if so, you have felt disappointed likewise; but I think this is 
not very probable, as the old man is particularly careful, and I never 
heard of his losing anything committed to his care.&nbsp; The note which I 
allude to was written on Thursday morning, and you should have received it 
before you left Bradford.&nbsp; I forget what its contents were, but I know
it was written in haste and concluded abruptly.&nbsp; Mr. Fennell talks of 
visiting Mr. Morgan to-morrow.&nbsp; I cannot lose the opportunity of 
sending this to the office by him as you will then have it a day sooner, 
and if you have been daily expecting to hear from me, twenty-four hours are
of some importance.&nbsp; I really am concerned to find that this, what 
many would deem trifling incident, has so much disturbed my mind.&nbsp; I 
fear I should not have slept in peace to-night if I had been deprived of 
this opportunity of relieving my mind by scribbling to you, and now I 
lament that you cannot possibly receive this till Monday.&nbsp; May I hope 
that there is now some intelligence on the way to me? or must my patience 
be tried till I see you on Wednesday?&nbsp; But what nonsense am I 
writing?&nbsp; Surely after this you can have no doubt that you possess all
my heart.&nbsp; Two months ago I could not possibly have believed that you 
would ever engross so much of my thoughts and affections, and far less 
could I have thought that I should be so forward as to tell you so.&nbsp; I
believe I must forbid you to come here again unless you can assure me that 
you will not steal any more of my regard.&nbsp; Enough of this; I must 
bring my pen to order, for if I were to suffer myself to revise what I have
written I should be tempted to throw it in the fire, but I have determined 
that <!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
45</span>you shall see my whole heart.&nbsp; I have not yet informed you 
that I received your serio-comic note on Thursday afternoon, for which 
accept my thanks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My cousin desires me to say that she expects a long poem on her 
birthday, when she attains the important age of twenty-one.&nbsp; Mr. 
Fennell joins with us in requesting that you will not fail to be here on 
Wednesday, as it is decided that on Thursday we are to go to the Abbey if 
the weather, etc., permits.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Sunday morning</i>.&mdash;I am not sure if I do right in 
adding a few lines to-day, but knowing that it will give you pleasure I 
wish to finish that you may have it to-morrow.&nbsp; I will just say that 
if my feeble prayers can aught avail, you will find your labours this day 
both pleasant and profitable, as they concern your own soul and the souls 
of those to whom you preach.&nbsp; I trust in your hours of retirement you 
will not forget to pray for me.&nbsp; I assure you I need every assistance 
to help me forward; I feel that my heart is more ready to attach itself to 
earth than heaven.&nbsp; I sometimes think there never was a mind so dull 
and inactive as mine is with regard to spiritual things.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must not forget to thank you for the pamphlets and tracts which
you sent us from Bradford.&nbsp; I hope we shall make good use of 
them.&nbsp; I must now take my leave.&nbsp; I believe I need scarcely 
assure you that I am yours truly and very affectionately,</p>

<p>&lsquo;With the sincerest pleasure do I retire from company to converse 
with him whom I love beyond all others.&nbsp; Could my beloved friend see 
my heart he would then be convinced that the affection I bear him is not at
all inferior to that which he feels for me&mdash;indeed I sometimes think 
that in truth and constancy it excels.&nbsp; But do not think from this 
that I entertain any suspicions of your sincerity&mdash;no, I firmly 
believe you to be sincere and generous, and doubt not in the least that you
feel all you express.&nbsp; In return, I entreat that you <!-- page 46--><a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>will do me the justice 
to believe that you have not only a <i>very large portion</i> of my 
<i>affection</i> and <i>esteem</i>, but <i>all</i> that I am capable of 
feeling, and from henceforth measure my feelings by your own.&nbsp; Unless 
my love for you were very great how could I so contentedly give up my home 
and all my friends&mdash;a home I loved so much that I have often thought 
nothing could bribe me to renounce it for any great length of time 
together, and friends with whom I have been so long accustomed to share all
the vicissitudes of joy and sorrow?&nbsp; Yet these have lost their weight,
and though I cannot always think of them without a sigh, yet the 
anticipation of sharing with you all the pleasures and pains, the cares and
anxieties of life, of contributing to your comfort and becoming the 
companion of your pilgrimage, is more delightful to me than any other 
prospect which this world can possibly present.&nbsp; I expected to have 
heard from you on Saturday last, and can scarcely refrain from thinking you
unkind to keep me in suspense two whole days longer than was necessary, but
it is well that my patience should be sometimes tried, or I might entirely 
lose it, and this would be a loss indeed!&nbsp; Lately I have experienced a
considerable increase of hopes and fears, which tend to destroy the calm 
uniformity of my life.&nbsp; These are not unwelcome, as they enable me to 
discover more of the evils and errors of my heart, and discovering them I 
hope through grace to be enabled to correct and amend them.&nbsp; I am 
sorry to say that my cousin has had a very serious cold, but to-day I think
she is better; her cough seems less, and I hope we shall be able to come to
Bradford on Saturday afternoon, where we intend to stop till Tuesday.&nbsp;
You may be sure we shall not soon think of taking such another journey as 
the last.&nbsp; I look forward with pleasure to Monday, when I hope to meet
with you, for as we are no <i>longer twain</i> separation is painful, and 
to meet must ever be attended with joy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Thursday morning</i>.&mdash;I intended to have finished this 
before breakfast, but unfortunately slept an hour too long.&nbsp; I am 
every moment in expectation of the old man&rsquo;s arrival.&nbsp; I hope my
cousin is still better to-day; she requests me to say that she is <!-- page
47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>much obliged to
you for your kind inquiries and the concern you express for her 
recovery.&nbsp; I take all possible care of her, but yesterday she was 
naughty enough to venture into the yard without her bonnet!&nbsp; As you do
not say anything of going to Leeds I conclude you have not been.&nbsp; We 
shall most probably hear from the Dr. this afternoon.&nbsp; I am much 
pleased to hear of his success at Bierly!&nbsp; O that you may both be 
zealous and successful in your efforts for the salvation of souls, and may 
your own lives be holy, and your hearts greatly blessed while you are 
engaged in administering to the good of others!&nbsp; I should have been 
very glad to have had it in my power to lessen your fatigue and cheer your 
spirits by my exertions on Monday last.&nbsp; I will hope that this 
pleasure is still reserved for me.&nbsp; In general, I feel a calm 
confidence in the providential care and continued mercy of God, and when I 
consider his past deliverances and past favours I am led to wonder and 
adore.&nbsp; A sense of my small returns of love and gratitude to him often
abases me and makes me think I am little better than those who profess no 
religion.&nbsp; Pray for me, my dear friend, and rest assured that you 
possess a very very large portion of the prayers, thoughts, and heart of 
yours truly,</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mr. Fennell requests Mr. Bedford to call on the man who has had

Grove</span>, <i>November</i> 18<i>th</i>, 1812.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear saucy Pat</span>,&mdash;Now 
don&rsquo;t you think you deserve this epithet far more than I do that 
which you have given me?&nbsp; I really know not what to make of the 
beginning of your last; the winds, waves, and rocks almost stunned 
me.&nbsp; I thought you were giving me the account of some terrible dream, 
or that you had had a presentiment of the fate of my poor box, having no 
idea that your lively imagination could make so much of the slight reproof 
conveyed in my last.&nbsp; What will you say when you get a <i>real</i>, 
<i>downright scolding</i>?&nbsp; Since you show such a readiness to atone 
<!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>for 
your offences after receiving a mild rebuke, I am inclined to hope you will
seldom deserve a severe one.&nbsp; I accept with pleasure your atonement, 
and send you a free and full forgiveness.&nbsp; But I cannot allow that 
your affection is more deeply rooted than mine.&nbsp; However, we will 
dispute no more about this, but rather embrace every opportunity to prove 
its sincerity and strength by acting in every respect as friends and 
fellow-pilgrims travelling the same road, actuated by the same motives, and
having in view the same end.&nbsp; I think if our lives are spared twenty 
years hence I shall then pray for you with the same, if not greater, 
fervour and delight that I do now.&nbsp; I am pleased that you are so fully
convinced of my candour, for to know that you suspected me of a deficiency 
in this virtue would grieve and mortify me beyond expression.&nbsp; I do 
not derive any merit from the possession of it, for in me it is 
constitutional.&nbsp; Yet I think where it is possessed it will rarely 
exist alone, and where it is wanted there is reason to doubt the existence 
of almost every other virtue.&nbsp; As to the other qualities which your 
partiality attributes to me, although I rejoice to know that I stand so 
high in your good opinion, yet I blush to think in how small a degree I 
possess them.&nbsp; But it shall be the pleasing study of my future life to
gain such an increase of grace and wisdom as shall enable me to act up to 
your highest expectations and prove to you a helpmeet.&nbsp; I firmly 
believe the Almighty has set us apart for each other; may we, by earnest, 
frequent prayer, and every possible exertion, endeavour to fulfil His will 
in all things!&nbsp; I do not, cannot, doubt your love, and here I freely 
declare I love you above all the world besides.&nbsp; I feel very, very 
grateful to the great Author of all our mercies for His unspeakable love 
and condescension towards us, and desire &ldquo;to show forth my gratitude 
not only with my lips, but by my life and conversation.&rdquo;&nbsp; I 
indulge a hope that our mutual prayers will be answered, and that our 
intimacy will tend much to promote our temporal and eternal interest.</p>
<p>[&lsquo;I suppose you never expected to be much the richer for me, but I
am sorry to inform you that I am still poorer than I <!-- page 49--><a 
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>thought myself.&nbsp; I
mentioned having sent for my books, clothes, etc.&nbsp; On Saturday evening
about the time you were writing the description of your imaginary 
shipwreck, I was reading and feeling the effects of a real one, having then
received a letter from my sister giving me an account of the vessel in 
which she had sent my box being stranded on the coast of Devonshire, in 
consequence of which the box was dashed to pieces with the violence of the 
sea, and all my little property, with the exception of a very few articles,
swallowed up in the mighty deep.&nbsp; If this should not prove the prelude
to something worse, I shall think little of it, as it is the first 
disastrous circumstance which has occurred since I left my home], <a 
name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49" class="citation">[49]</a> and 
having been so highly favoured it would be highly ungrateful in me were I 
to suffer this to dwell much on my mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Morgan was here yesterday, indeed he only left this 
morning.&nbsp; He mentioned having written to invite you to Bierly on 
Sunday next, and if you complied with his request it is likely that we 
shall see you both here on Sunday evening.&nbsp; As we intend going to 
Leeds next week, we should be happy if you would accompany us on Monday or 
Tuesday.&nbsp; I mention this by desire of Miss Fennell, who begs to be 
remembered affectionately to you.&nbsp; Notwithstanding Mr. Fennell&rsquo;s
complaints and threats, I doubt not but he will give you a cordial 
reception whenever you think fit to make your appearance at the 
Grove.&nbsp; Which you may likewise be assured of receiving from your ever 
truly affectionate,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dearest Friend</span>,&mdash;So you 
<i>thought</i> that <i>perhaps</i> I <i>might</i> expect to hear from 
you.&nbsp; As the case was so doubtful, and you <!-- page 50--><a 
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>were in such great 
haste, you might as well have deferred writing a few days longer, for you 
seem to suppose it is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether I hear
from you or not.&nbsp; I believe I once requested you to judge of my 
feelings by your own&mdash;am I to think that <i>you</i> are thus 
indifferent?&nbsp; I feel very unwilling to entertain such an opinion, and 
am grieved that you should suspect me of such a cold, heartless, 
attachment.&nbsp; But I am too serious on the subject; I only meant to 
rally you a little on the beginning of your last, and to tell you that I 
fancied there was a coolness in it which none of your former letters had 
contained.&nbsp; If this fancy was groundless, forgive me for having 
indulged it, and let it serve to convince you of the sincerity and warmth 
of my affection.&nbsp; Real love is ever apt to suspect that it meets not 
with an equal return; you must not wonder then that my fears are sometimes 
excited.&nbsp; My pride cannot bear the idea of a diminution of your 
attachment, or to think that it is stronger on my side than on yours.&nbsp;
But I must not permit my pen so fully to disclose the feelings of my heart,
nor will I tell you whether I am pleased or not at the thought of seeing 
you on the appointed day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Fennell desires her kind regards, and, with her father, is 
extremely obliged to you for the trouble you have taken about the carpet, 
and has no doubt but it will give full satisfaction.&nbsp; They think there
will be no occasion for the green cloth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We intend to set about making the cakes here next week, but as 
the fifteen or twenty persons whom you mention live probably somewhere in 
your neighbourhood, I think it will be most convenient for Mrs. B. to make 
a small one for the purpose of distributing there, which will save us the 
difficulty of sending so far.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may depend on my learning my lessons as rapidly as they are 
given me.&nbsp; I am already tolerably perfect in the A B C, etc.&nbsp; I 
am much obliged to you for the pretty little hymn which I have already got 
by heart, but cannot promise to sing it scientifically, though I will 
endeavour to gain a little more assurance.</p>
<p><!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
51</span>&lsquo;Since I began this Jane put into my hands Lord 
Lyttelton&rsquo;s <i>Advice to a Lady</i>.&nbsp; When I read those lines, 
&ldquo;Be never cool reserve with passion joined, with caution choose, but 
then be fondly kind, etc.&rdquo; my heart smote me for having in some cases
used too much reserve towards you.&nbsp; Do you think you have any cause to
complain of me?&nbsp; If you do, let me know it.&nbsp; For were it in my 
power to prevent it, I would in no instance occasion you the least pain or 
uneasiness.&nbsp; I am certain no one ever loved you with an affection more
pure, constant, tender, and ardent than that which I feel.&nbsp; Surely 
this is not saying too much; it is the truth, and I trust you are worthy to
know it.&nbsp; I long to improve in every religious and moral quality, that
I may be a help, and if possible an ornament to you.&nbsp; Oh let us pray 
much for wisdom and grace to fill our appointed stations with propriety, 
that we may enjoy satisfaction in our own souls, edify others, and bring 
glory to the name of Him who has so wonderfully preserved, blessed, and 
brought us together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If there is anything in the commencement of this which looks like
pettishness, forgive it; my mind is now completely divested of every 
feeling of the kind, although I own I am sometimes too apt to be overcome 
by this disposition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me have the pleasure of hearing from you again as soon as 
convenient.&nbsp; This writing is uncommonly bad, but I too am in 
haste.</p>

<p>Mr. Bront&euml; was at Hartshead, where he married, for five years, and 
there his two eldest children, Maria and Elizabeth, were born.&nbsp; He 
then moved to Thornton, near Bradford, where Charlotte was born on the 21st
of April 1816, Branwell in 1817, Emily in 1818, and Anne in 1819.&nbsp; In 
1820 the family removed to the parsonage of Haworth, and in 1821 the poor 
mother was dead.&nbsp; A year or two later Miss Elizabeth Branwell came 
from Penzance to act as a mother to her orphaned nephew and nieces.&nbsp; 
There is no reason to accept the theory that Miss Branwell was quite <!-- 
page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>as 
formidable or offensive a personage as the Mrs. Read in <i>Jane 
Eyre</i>.&nbsp; That she was a somewhat rigid and not over demonstrative 
woman, we may take for granted.&nbsp; The one letter to her of any 
importance that I have seen&mdash;it is printed in Mrs. Gaskell&rsquo;s 
life&mdash;was the attempt of Charlotte to obtain her co-operation in the 
projected visit to a Brussels school.&nbsp; Miss Branwell provided the 
money readily enough it would seem, and one cannot doubt that in her later 
years she was on the best of terms with her nieces.&nbsp; There may have 
been too much discipline in childhood, but discipline which would now be 
considered too severe was common enough at the beginning of the 
century.&nbsp; The children, we may be sure, were left abundantly 
alone.&nbsp; The writing they accomplished in their early years would 
sufficiently demonstrate that.&nbsp; Miss Branwell died in 1842; and from 
her will, which I give elsewhere, it will be seen that she behaved very 
justly to her three nieces.</p>
<p>The reception by Mr. Bront&euml; of his children&rsquo;s literary 
successes has been very pleasantly recorded by Charlotte.&nbsp; He was 
proud of his daughters, and delighted with their fame.&nbsp; He seems to 
have had no small share of their affection.&nbsp; Charlotte loved and 
esteemed him.&nbsp; There are hundreds of her letters, in many of which are
severe and indeed unprintable things about this or that individual; but of 
her father these letters contain not one single harsh word.&nbsp; She wrote
to him regularly when absent.&nbsp; Not only did he secure the affection of
his daughter, but the people most intimately associated with him next to 
his own children gave him a lifelong affection and regard.&nbsp; Martha 
Brown, the servant who lived with him until his death, always insisted that
her old master had been grievously wronged, and that a kinder, more 
generous, and in every way more worthy man had never lived.&nbsp; Nancy 
Garrs, another servant, always spoke of Mr. Bront&euml; as &lsquo;the 
kindest man who ever drew breath,&rsquo; and as a good and affectionate 
father.&nbsp; Forty years have gone by <!-- page 53--><a 
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>since Charlotte 
Bront&euml; died; and thirty-six years have flown since Mr. Nicholls left 
the deathbed of his wife&rsquo;s father; but through all that period he has
retained the most kindly memories of one with whom his life was intimately 
associated for sixteen years, with whom at one crisis of his life, as we 
shall see, he had a serious difference, but whom he ever believed to have 
been an entirely honourable and upright man.</p>
<p>A lady visitor to Haworth in December 1860 did not, it is true, carry 
away quite so friendly an impression.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have been to see old 
Mr. Bront&euml;,&rsquo; she writes, &lsquo;and have spent about an hour 
with him.&nbsp; He is completely confined to his bed, but talks hopefully 
of leaving it again when the summer comes round.&nbsp; I am afraid that it 
will not be leaving it as he plans, poor old man!&nbsp; He is touchingly 
softened by illness; but still talks in his pompous way, and mingles moral 
remarks and somewhat stale sentiments with his conversation on ordinary 
subjects.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is severe, but after all it was a literary 
woman who wrote it.&nbsp; On the whole we may safely assume, with the 
evidence before us, that Mr. Bront&euml; was a thoroughly upright and 
honourable man who came manfully through a somewhat severe life 
battle.&nbsp; That is how his daughters thought of him, and we cannot do 
better than think with them. <a name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"

<p>&lsquo;Great numbers of people had collected in the churchyard, and a

the following clergymen were the bearers of the coffin: The Rev. Dr. 
Cartman of Skipton; Rev. Mr. Sowden of Hebden Bridge; the Incumbents of 
Cullingworth, Oakworth, Morton, Oxenhope, and St. John&rsquo;s 
Ingrow.&nbsp; The chief mourners were the Rev. Arthur Bell Nicholls, 
son-in-law of the deceased; Martha Brown, the housekeeper; and her sister; 
Mrs. Brown, and Mrs. Wainwright.&nbsp; There were several gentlemen 
followed the corpse whom we did not know.&nbsp; All the shops in Haworth 
were closed, and the people filled every pew, and the aisles in the church,
and many shed tears during the impressive reading of the service for the 
burial of the dead, by the vicar.&nbsp; The body of Mr. Bront&euml; was 
laid within the altar rails, by the side of his daughter Charlotte.&nbsp; 
He is the last that can be interred inside of Haworth Church.&nbsp; On the 
coffin was this inscription: &ldquo;Patrick Bront&euml;, died June 7th, 
1861, aged 84 years.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Irish relatives are not forgotten, and indeed this will gives the

56</span>CHAPTER II: CHILDHOOD</h2>
<p>Eighty years have passed over Thornton since that village had the honour
of becoming the birthplace of Charlotte Bront&euml;.&nbsp; The visitor of 
to-day will find the Bell Chapel, in which Mr. Bront&euml; officiated, a 
mere ruin, and the font in which his children were baptized ruthlessly 
exposed to the winds of heaven. <a name="citation56a"></a><a 
href="#footnote56a" class="citation">[56a]</a>&nbsp; The house in which 
Patrick Bront&euml; resided is now a butcher&rsquo;s shop, and indeed 
little, one imagines, remains the same.&nbsp; But within the new church one
may still overhaul the registers, and find, with but little trouble, a 
record of the baptism of the Bront&euml; children.&nbsp; There, amid the 
names of the rough and rude peasantry of the neighbourhood, we find the 
accompanying entries, <a name="citation56b"></a><a href="#footnote56b" 
class="citation">[56b]</a> differing from their neighbours only by the fact
that Mr. Morgan or Mr. Fennell came to the help of their relatives and 
officiated in place of Mr. Bront&euml;.&nbsp; Mr. Bront&euml;, it will be 
observed, had already received his appointment to Haworth when Anne was 
baptized.</p>
<p>There were, it is well known, two elder children, Maria and Elizabeth, 
born at Hartshead, and doomed to die speedily at Haworth.&nbsp; A vague 
memory of Maria lives in the Helen Burns of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, but the only 
tangible records of the pair, as far as I am able to ascertain, are a 
couple of samplers, of the kind which Mrs. Bront&euml; and her sisters had 
worked at Penzance a generation earlier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
57</span><i>Maria Bront&euml; finished this Sampler on the 16th of May at 
the age of eight years</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>one of them tells us, and the other:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Elizabeth Bront&euml; finished this Sampler the 27th of July at the 
age of seven years</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maria died at the age of twelve in May 1825, and Elizabeth in June of 
the same year, at the age of eleven.&nbsp; It is, however, with their three
sisters that we have most concern, although all the six children 
accompanied their parents to Haworth in 1820.</p>
<p><!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
58</span>Haworth, we are told, has been over-described; and yet it may not 
be amiss to discover from the easily available directories what manner of 
place it was during the Bront&euml; residence there.&nbsp; Pigot&rsquo;s 
Yorkshire Directory of 1828 gives the census during the first year of Mr. 
Bront&euml;&rsquo;s incumbency thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, <i>a populous manufacturing 
village</i>, <i>in the honour of Pontefract</i>, <i>Morley wapentake</i>, 
<i>and in the parish of Bradford</i>, <i>is four miles south of

<i>inhabitants</i>.</p>

<i>Rev. Moses</i>, <i>Haworth</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the same source twenty years later we obtain more explicit detail, 
which is not without interest to-day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Haworth</span> <i>is a chapelry</i>, <i>comprising 
the hamlets of Haworth</i>, <i>Stanbury</i>, <i>and Near and Far

<p>Haworth needs even to-day no further description, but the house in which
Mr. Bront&euml; resided, from 1820 till his death in 1861, has not been 
over-described, perhaps because Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s successor has not 
been too well disposed to receive the casual visitor to Haworth under his 
roof.</p>
<p>Many changes have been made since Mr. Bront&euml; died, but the house 
still retains its essentially interesting features.&nbsp; In the time of 
the Bront&euml;s, it is true, the front outlook was as desolate as to-day 
it is attractive.&nbsp; Then there was a little piece of barren ground 
running down to the walls of the churchyard, with here and there a 
currant-bush as the sole adornment.&nbsp; Now we see an abundance of trees 
and a well-kept lawn.&nbsp; Miss Ellen Nussey well remembers seeing Emily 
and Anne, on a fine summer afternoon, sitting on stools in this bit of 
garden plucking currants from the poor insignificant bushes.&nbsp; There 
was no premonition of the time, not so far distant, when the rough doorway 
separating the churchyard from the garden, which was opened for their 
mother when they were little children, should be opened again time after 
time in rapid succession for their own biers to be carried through.&nbsp; 
This gateway is now effectively bricked up.&nbsp; In the days of the 
Bront&euml;s it was reserved for the <!-- page 60--><a 
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>passage of the 
dead&mdash;a grim arrangement, which, strange to say, finds no place in any
one of the sisters&rsquo; stories.&nbsp; We enter the house, and the door 
on the right leads into Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s study, always called the 
parlour; that on the left into the dining-room, where the children spent a 
great portion of their lives.&nbsp; From childhood to womanhood, indeed, 
the three girls regularly breakfasted with their father in his study.&nbsp;
In the dining-room&mdash;a square and simple room of a kind common enough 
in the houses of the poorer middle-classes&mdash;they ate their mid-day 
dinner, their tea and supper.&nbsp; Mr. Bront&euml; joined them at tea, 
although he always dined alone in his study.&nbsp; The children&rsquo;s 
dinner-table has been described to me by a visitor to the house.&nbsp; At 
one end sat Miss Branwell, at the other, Charlotte, with Emily and Anne on 
either side.&nbsp; Branwell was then absent.&nbsp; The living was of the 
simplest.&nbsp; A single joint, followed invariably by one kind or another 
of milk-pudding.&nbsp; Pastry was unknown in the Bront&euml; 
household.&nbsp; Milk-puddings, or food composed of milk and rice, would 
seem to have made the principal diet of Emily and Anne Bront&euml;, and to 
this they added a breakfast of Scotch porridge, which they shared with 
their dogs.&nbsp; It is more interesting, perhaps, to think of all the 
daydreams in that room, of the mass of writing which was achieved there, of
the conversations and speculation as to the future.&nbsp; Miss Nussey has 
given a pleasant picture of twilight when Charlotte and she walked with 
arms encircling one another round and round the table, and Emily and Anne 
followed in similar fashion.&nbsp; There was no lack of cheerfulness and of
hope at that period.&nbsp; Behind Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s studio was the 
kitchen; and there we may easily picture the Bront&euml; children telling 
stories to Tabby or Martha, or to whatever servant reigned at the time, and
learning, as all of them did, to become thoroughly domesticated&mdash;Emily
most of all.&nbsp; Behind the dining-room was a <!-- page 61--><a 
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>peat-room, which, when 
Charlotte was married in 1854, was cleared out and converted into a little 
study for Mr. Nicholls.&nbsp; The staircase with its solid banister remains
as it did half a century ago; and at its foot one is still shown the corner
which tradition assigns as the scene of Emily&rsquo;s conflict with her dog
Keeper.&nbsp; On the right, at the back, as you mount the staircase, was a 
small room allotted to Branwell as a studio.&nbsp; On the other side of 
this staircase, also at the back, was the servants&rsquo; room.&nbsp; In 
the front of the house, immediately over the dining-room, was Miss 
Branwell&rsquo;s room, afterwards the spare bedroom until Charlotte 
Bront&euml; married.&nbsp; In that room she died.&nbsp; On the left, over 
Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s study, was Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s bedroom.&nbsp; 
It was the room which, for many years, he shared with Branwell, and it was 
in that room that Branwell and his father died at an interval of twenty 
years.&nbsp; On the staircase, half-way up, was a grandfather&rsquo;s 
clock, which Mr. Bront&euml; used to wind up every night on his way to 
bed.&nbsp; He always went to bed at nine o&rsquo;clock, and Miss Nussey 
well remembers his stentorian tones as he called out as he left his study 
and passed the dining-room door&mdash;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be up late, 
children&rsquo;&mdash;which they usually were.&nbsp; Between these two 
front rooms upstairs, and immediately over the passage, with a door facing 
the staircase, was a box room; but this was the children&rsquo;s nursery, 
where for many years the children slept, where the bulk of their little 
books were compiled, and where, it is more than probable, <i>The 
Professor</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i> were composed.</p>
<p>Of the work of the Bront&euml; children in these early years, a great 
deal might be written.&nbsp; Mrs. Gaskell gives a list of some eighteen 
booklets, but at least eighteen more from the pen of Charlotte are in 
existence.&nbsp; Branwell was equally prolific; and of him, also, there 
remains an immense mass of childish effort.&nbsp; That Emily and Anne were 
industrious in a like measure there is abundant reason to <!-- page 62--><a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>believe; but scarcely 
one of their juvenile efforts remains to us, nor even the unpublished 
fragments of later years, to which reference will be made a little 
later.&nbsp; Whether Emily and Anne on the eve of their death deliberately 
destroyed all their treasures, or whether they were destroyed by Charlotte 
in the days of her mourning, will never be known.&nbsp; Meanwhile one turns
with interest to the efforts of Charlotte and Branwell.&nbsp; 
Charlotte&rsquo;s little stories commence in her thirteenth year, and go on
until she is twenty-three.&nbsp; From thirteen to eighteen she would seem 
to have had one absorbing hero.&nbsp; It was the Duke of Wellington; and 
her hero-worship extended to the children of the Duke, who, indeed, would 
seem even more than their father to have absorbed her childish 
affections.&nbsp; Whether the stories are fairy tales or dramas of modern 
life, they all alike introduce the Marquis of Douro, who afterwards became 
the second Duke of Wellington, and Lord Charles Wellesley, whose son is now
the third Duke of Wellington.&nbsp; The length of some of these fragments 
is indeed incredible.&nbsp; They fill but a few sheets of notepaper in that
tiny handwriting; but when copied by zealous admirers, it is seen that more
than one of them is twenty thousand words in length.</p>
<p><i>The Foundling</i>, by Captain Tree, written in 1833, is a story of 
thirty-five thousand words, though the manuscript has only eighteen 
pages.&nbsp; <i>The Green Dwarf</i>, written in the same year, is even 
longer, and indeed after her return from Roe Head in 1833, Charlotte must 
have devoted herself to continuous writing.&nbsp; <i>The Adventures of 
Ernest Alembert</i> is a booklet of this date, and <i>Arthuriana</i>, <i>or
Odds and Ends</i>: <i>being a Miscellaneous Collection of Pieces in Prose 
and Verse</i>, by Lord Charles Wellesley, is yet another.</p>
<p>The son of the Iron Duke is made to talk, in these little books, in a 
way which would have gladdened the heart of a modern interviewer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Lord Charles,&rsquo; said Mr. Rundle to me one afternoon lately, 
<!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
63</span>&lsquo;I have an engagement to drink tea with an old college chum 
this evening, so I shall give you sixty lines of the <i>&AElig;neid</i> to 
get ready during my absence.&nbsp; If it is not ready by the time I come 
back you know the consequences.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Very well, Sir,&rsquo; 
said I, bringing out the books with a prodigious bustle, and making a show 
as if I intended to learn a whole book instead of sixty lines of the 
<i>&AElig;neid</i>.&nbsp; This appearance of industry, however, lasted no 
longer than until the old gentleman&rsquo;s back was turned.&nbsp; No 
sooner had he fairly quitted the room than I flung aside the musty tomes, 
took my cap, and speeding through chamber, hall, and gallery, was soon 
outside the gates of Waterloo Palace.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>The Secret</i>, another story, of which Mrs. Gaskell gave a facsimile
of the first page, was also written in 1833, and indeed in this, her 
seventeenth year, Charlotte Bront&euml; must have written as much as in any
year of her life.&nbsp; When at Roe Head, 1832-3, she would seem to have 
worked at her studies, and particularly her drawing; but in the interval 
between Cowan Bridge and Roe Head she wrote a great deal.&nbsp; The 
earliest manuscripts in my possession bear date 1829&mdash;that is to say, 
in Charlotte&rsquo;s thirteenth year.&nbsp; They are her <i>Tales of the 
Islanders</i>, which extend to four little volumes in brown paper covers 
neatly inscribed &lsquo;First Volume,&rsquo; &lsquo;Second Volume,&rsquo; 
and so on.&nbsp; The Duke is of absorbing importance in these 
&lsquo;Tales.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;One evening the Duke of Wellington was 
writing in his room in Downing Street.&nbsp; He was reposing at his ease in
a simple easy chair, smoking a homely tobacco-pipe, for he disdained all 
the modern frippery of cigars . . . &rsquo; and so on in an abundance of 
childish imaginings.&nbsp; <i>The Search after Happiness</i> and 
<i>Characters of Great Men of the Present Time</i> were also written in 
1829.&nbsp; Perhaps the only juvenile fragment which is worth anything is 
also the only one in which she escapes from the Wellington 
enthusiasm.&nbsp; It has an interest also in indicating that Charlotte in 
her girlhood heard something of her father&rsquo;s native land.&nbsp; It is
called&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>AN ADVENTURE IN IRELAND</p>
<p>During my travels in the south of Ireland the following adventure 
happened to me.&nbsp; One evening in the month of August, after a long 
walk, I was ascending the mountain which overlooks the village of Cahill, 
when I suddenly came in sight of a fine old castle.&nbsp; It was built upon
a rock, and behind it was a large wood and before it was a river.&nbsp; 
Over the river there was a bridge, which formed the approach to the 
castle.&nbsp; When I arrived at the bridge I stood still awhile to enjoy 
the prospect around me: far below was the wide sheet of still water in 
which the reflection of the pale moon was not disturbed by the smallest 
wave; in the valley was the cluster of cabins which is known by the 
appellation of Cahin, and beyond these were the mountains of Killala.&nbsp;
Over all, the grey robe of twilight was now stealing with silent and 
scarcely perceptible advances.&nbsp; No sound except the hum of the distant
village and the sweet song of the nightingale in the wood behind me broke 
upon the stillness of the scene.&nbsp; While I was contemplating this 
beautiful prospect, a gentleman, whom I had not before observed, accosted 
me with &lsquo;Good evening, sir; are you a stranger in these 
parts?&rsquo;&nbsp; I replied that I was.&nbsp; He then asked me where I 
was going to stop for the night; I answered that I intended to sleep 
somewhere in the village.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am afraid you will find very bad 
accommodation there,&rsquo; said the gentleman; &lsquo;but if you will take
up your quarters with me at the castle, you are welcome.&rsquo;&nbsp; I 
thanked him for his kind offer, and accepted it.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the castle I was shown into a large parlour, in which
was an old lady sitting in an arm-chair by the fireside, knitting.&nbsp; On
the rug lay a very pretty tortoise-shell cat.&nbsp; As soon as mentioned, 
the old lady rose; and when Mr. O&rsquo;Callaghan (for that, I learned, was
his name) told her who I was, she said in the most cordial tone that I was 
welcome, and asked me to sit down.&nbsp; In the course of conversation I 
learned that she was Mr. O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s mother, and that his 
father had been dead about a year.&nbsp; We <!-- page 65--><a 
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>had sat about an hour, 
when supper was announced, and after supper Mr. O&rsquo;Callaghan asked me 
if I should like to retire for the night.&nbsp; I answered in the 
affirmative, and a little boy was commissioned to show me to my 
apartment.&nbsp; It was a snug, clean, and comfortable little old-fashioned
room at the top of the castle.&nbsp; As soon as we had entered, the boy, 
who appeared to be a shrewd, good-tempered little fellow, said with a shrug
of the shoulder, &lsquo;If it was going to bed I was, it shouldn&rsquo;t be
here that you&rsquo;d catch me.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; said 
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Because,&rsquo; replied the boy, &lsquo;they say that the 
ould masther&rsquo;s ghost has been seen sitting on that there 
chair.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;And have you seen him?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No; 
but I&rsquo;ve heard him washing his hands in that basin often and 
often.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What is your name, my little 
fellow?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Dennis Mulready, please your 
honour.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, good-night to you.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Good-night, masther; and may the saints keep you from all fairies 
and brownies,&rsquo; said Dennis as he left the room.</p>
<p>As soon as I had laid down I began to think of what the boy had been 
telling me, and I confess I felt a strange kind of fear, and once or twice 
I even thought I could discern something white through the darkness which 
surrounded me.&nbsp; At length, by the help of reason, I succeeded in 
mastering these, what some would call idle fancies, and fell asleep.&nbsp; 
I had slept about an hour when a strange sound awoke me, and I saw looking 
through my curtains a skeleton wrapped in a white sheet.&nbsp; I was 
overcome with terror and tried to scream, but my tongue was paralysed and 
my whole frame shook with fear.&nbsp; In a deep hollow voice it said to me,
&lsquo;Arise, that I may show thee this world&rsquo;s wonders,&rsquo; and 
in an instant I found myself encompassed with clouds and darkness.&nbsp; 
But soon the roar of mighty waters fell upon my ear, and I saw some clouds 
of spray arising from high falls that rolled in awful majesty down 
tremendous precipices, and then foamed and thundered in the gulf beneath as
if they had taken up their unquiet abode in some giant&rsquo;s 
cauldron.&nbsp; But soon the scene changed, and I found myself in the mines
of Cracone.&nbsp; There were high pillars and stately arches, whose 
glittering splendour was never excelled by the brightest fairy 
palaces.&nbsp; There were not many lamps, only <!-- page 66--><a 
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>those of a few poor 
miners, whose rough visages formed a striking contrast to the dazzling 
figures and grandeur which surrounded them.&nbsp; But in the midst of all 
this magnificence I felt an indescribable sense of fear and terror, for the
sea raged above us, and by the awful and tumultuous noises of roaring winds
and dashing waves, it seemed as if the storm was violent.&nbsp; And now the
mossy pillars groaned beneath the pressure of the ocean, and the glittering
arches seemed about to be overwhelmed.&nbsp; When I heard the rushing 
waters and saw a mighty flood rolling towards me I gave a loud shriek of 
terror.&nbsp; The scene vanished, and I found myself in a wide desert full 
of barren rocks and high mountains.&nbsp; As I was approaching one of the 
rocks, in which there was a large cave, my foot stumbled and I fell.&nbsp; 
Just then I heard a deep growl, and saw by the unearthly light of his own 
fiery eyes a royal lion rousing himself from his kingly slumbers.&nbsp; His
terrible eye was fixed upon me, and the desert rang and the rocks echoed 
with the tremendous roar of fierce delight which he uttered as he sprang 
towards me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, masther, it&rsquo;s been a windy night, 
though it&rsquo;s fine now,&rsquo; said Dennis, as he drew the 
window-curtain and let the bright rays of the morning sun into the little 
old-fashioned room at the top of O&rsquo;Callaghan Castle.</p>

<p>Six numbers of <i>The Young Men&rsquo;s Magazine</i> were written in 
1829; a very juvenile poem, <i>The Evening Walk</i>, by the Marquis of 
Douro, in 1830; and another, of greater literary value, <i>The Violet</i>, 
in the same year.&nbsp; In 1831 we have an unfinished poem, <i>The Trumpet 
Hath Sounded</i>; and in 1832 a very long poem called <i>The 
Bridal</i>.&nbsp; Some of them, as for example a poem called <i>Richard 
Coeur de Lion and Blondel</i>, are written in penny and twopenny notebooks 
of the kind used by laundresses.&nbsp; Occasionally her father has 
purchased a sixpenny book and has written within the cover&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>All that is written in this book must be in a good</i>, <i>plain</i>,
<i>and legible hand</i>.&mdash;P. B.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
67</span>While upon this topic, I may as well carry the record up to the 
date of publication of Currer Bell&rsquo;s poems.&nbsp; <i>A Leaf from an 
Unopened Volume</i> was written in 1834, as were also <i>The Death of 
Darius</i>, and <i>Corner Dishes</i>.&nbsp; <i>Saul</i>: <i>a Poem</i>, was
written in 1835, and a number of other still unpublished verses.&nbsp; 
There is a story called <i>Lord Douro</i>, bearing date 1837, and a 
manuscript book of verses of 1838, but that pretty well exhausts the 
manuscripts before me previous to the days of serious literary 
activity.&nbsp; During the years as private governess (1839-1841) and the 
Brussels experiences (1842-1844), Charlotte would seem to have put all 
literary effort on one side.</p>
<p>There is only one letter of Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s 
childhood.&nbsp; It is indorsed by Mr. Bront&euml; on the cover 
<i>Charlotte&rsquo;s First Letter</i>, possibly for the guidance of Mrs. 
Gaskell, who may perhaps have thought it of insufficient importance.&nbsp; 
That can scarcely be the opinion of any one to-day.&nbsp; Charlotte, aged 
thirteen, is staying with the Fennells, her mother&rsquo;s friends of those
early love-letters.</p>

we shall be at home on Friday by dinner-time, when we hope to find you in

but notwithstanding we have spent our time very pleasantly, between 
reading, working, and learning our lessons, which Uncle Fennell has been so
kind as to teach us every day.&nbsp; Branwell has taken two sketches from 
nature, and Emily, Anne, and myself have likewise each of us drawn a piece 
from some views of the lakes which Mr. Fennell brought with him from 
Westmoreland.&nbsp; The whole of these he intends keeping.&nbsp; Mr. 
Fennell is sorry he cannot accompany us to Haworth on Friday, for want of 
room, <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

74</span>CHAPTER III: SCHOOL AND GOVERNESS LIFE</h2>
<p>In seeking for fresh light upon the development of Charlotte 
Bront&euml;, it is not necessary to discuss further her childhood&rsquo;s 
years at Cowan Bridge.&nbsp; She left the school at nine years of age, and 
what memories of it were carried into womanhood were, with more or less of 
picturesque colouring, embodied in Jane Eyre. <a name="citation74"></a><a 
href="#footnote74" class="citation">[74]</a>&nbsp; From 1825 to 1831 <!-- 
page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>Charlotte 
was at home with her sisters, reading and writing as we have seen, but 
learning nothing very systematically.&nbsp; In 1831-32 she was a boarder at
Miss Wooler&rsquo;s school at Roe Head, some twenty miles from 
Haworth.&nbsp; Miss Wooler lived to a green old age, dying in the year 
1885.&nbsp; She would seem to have been very proud of her famous pupil, and
could not have been blind to her capacity in the earlier years.&nbsp; 
Charlotte was with her as governess at Roe Head, and later at Dewsbury 
Moor.&nbsp; It is quite clear that Miss Bront&euml; was head of the school 
in all intellectual pursuits, and she made two firm friends&mdash;Ellen 
Nussey and Mary Taylor.&nbsp; A very fair measure of French and some skill 
in drawing appear to have been the most striking <!-- page 76--><a 
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>accomplishments which 
Charlotte carried back from Roe Head to Haworth.&nbsp; There are some 
twenty drawings of about this date, and a translation into English verse of
the first book of Voltaire&rsquo;s <i>Henriade</i>.&nbsp; With Ellen Nussey
commenced a friendship which terminated only with the pencilled notes 
written from Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s deathbed.&nbsp; The first 
suggestion of a regular correspondence is contained in the following 
letter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>July</i> 21<i>st</i>, 1832.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dearest Ellen</span>,&mdash;Your kind and 
interesting letter gave me the sincerest pleasure.&nbsp; I have been 
expecting to hear from you almost every day since my arrival at home, and I
at length began to despair of receiving the wished-for letter.&nbsp; You 
ask me to give you a description of the manner in which I have passed every
day since I left school.&nbsp; This is soon done, as an account of one day 
is an account of all.&nbsp; In the mornings, from nine o&rsquo;clock to 
half-past twelve, I instruct my sisters and draw, then we walk till dinner;
after dinner I sew till tea-time, and after tea I either read, write, do a 
little fancy-work, or draw, as I please.&nbsp; Thus in one delightful, 
though somewhat monotonous course, my life is passed.&nbsp; I have only 
been out to tea twice since I came home.&nbsp; We are expecting company 
this afternoon, and on Tuesday next we shall have all the female teachers 
of the Sunday school to tea.&nbsp; I do hope, my dearest Ellen, that you 
will return to school again for your own sake, though for mine I would 
rather that you would remain at home, as we shall then have more frequent 
opportunities of correspondence with each other.&nbsp; Should your friends 
decide against your returning to school, I know you have too much 
good-sense and right feeling not to strive earnestly for your own 
improvement.&nbsp; Your natural abilities are excellent, and under the 
direction of a judicious and able friend (and I know you have many such), 
you might acquire a decided taste for elegant literature, and even poetry, 
which, indeed, is included under that general term.&nbsp; I was very much 
disappointed by your not sending the hair; you may be sure, my <!-- page 
77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>dearest Ellen, 
that I would not grudge double postage to obtain it, but I must offer the 
same excuse for not sending you any.&nbsp; My aunt and sisters desire their
love to you.&nbsp; Remember me kindly to your mother and sisters, and 
accept all the fondest expressions of genuine attachment, from your real 
friend</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Charlotte 
Bront&euml;</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Remember the mutual promise we made of a 
regular correspondence with each other.&nbsp; Excuse all faults in this 
wretched scrawl.&nbsp; Give my love to the Miss Taylors when you see 
them.&nbsp; Farewell, my <i>dear</i>, <i>dear</i>, <i>dear</i> 
Ellen.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reading, writing, and as thorough a domestic training as the little 
parsonage could afford, made up the next few years.&nbsp; Then came the 
determination to be a governess&mdash;a not unnatural resolution when the 
size of the family and the modest stipend of its head are considered.&nbsp;
Far more prosperous parents are content in our day that their daughters 
should earn their living in this manner.&nbsp; In 1835 Charlotte went back 
to Roe Head as governess, and she continued in that position when Miss 
Wooler removed her school to Dewsbury Moor in 1836.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dewsbury 
Moor</span>, <i>August</i> 24<i>th</i>, 1837.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I have determined
to write lest you should begin to think I have forgotten you, and in 
revenge resolve to forget me.&nbsp; As you will perceive by the date of 
this letter, I am again engaged in the old business&mdash;teach, teach, 
teach.&nbsp; Miss and Mrs. Wooler are coming here next Christmas.&nbsp; 
Miss Wooler will then relinquish the school in favour of her sister Eliza, 
but I am happy to say worthy Miss Wooler will continue to reside in the 
house.&nbsp; I should be sorry indeed to part with her.&nbsp; When will you
come <i>home</i>?&nbsp; Make haste, you have been at Bath long enough for 
all purposes.&nbsp; By this time you have acquired polish enough, I am 
sure.&nbsp; If the varnish is laid on much thicker, I am afraid the good 
wood underneath will be quite concealed, and your old Yorkshire <!-- page 
78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>friends 
won&rsquo;t stand that.&nbsp; Come, come, I am getting really tired of your
absence.&nbsp; Saturday after Saturday comes round, and I can have no hope 
of hearing your knock at the door and then being told that &ldquo;Miss E. 
N. is come.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh dear! in this monotonous life of mine that was 
a pleasant event.&nbsp; I wish it would recur again, but it will take two 
or three interviews before the stiffness, the estrangement of this long 
separation will quite wear away.&nbsp; I have nothing at all to tell you 
now but that Mary Taylor is better, and that she and Martha are gone to 
take a tour in Wales.&nbsp; Patty came on her pony about a fortnight since 
to inform me that this important event was in contemplation.&nbsp; She 
actually began to fret about your long absence, and to express the most 
eager wishes for your return.&nbsp; My own dear Ellen, good-bye.&nbsp; If 
we are all spared I hope soon to see you again.&nbsp; God bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. 
Bront&euml;</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things were not always going on quite so smoothly, as the following 
letter indicates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dewsbury 
Moor</span>, <i>January</i> 4<i>th</i>, 1838.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your letter, Ellen, was a welcome surprise, though it contained 
something like a reprimand.&nbsp; I had not, however, forgotten our 
agreement.&nbsp; You were right in your conjectures respecting the cause of
my sudden departure.&nbsp; Anne continued wretchedly ill, neither the pain 
nor the difficulty of breathing left her, and how could I feel otherwise 
than very miserable.&nbsp; I looked on her case in a different light to 
what I could wish or expect any uninterested person to view it in.&nbsp; 
Miss Wooler thought me a fool, and by way of proving her opinion treated me
with marked coldness.&nbsp; We came to a little &eacute;claircissement one 
evening.&nbsp; I told her one or two rather plain truths, which set her 
a-crying; and the next day, unknown to me, she wrote papa, telling him that
I had reproached her bitterly, taken her severely to task, etc.&nbsp; Papa 
sent for us the day after he had received her letter.&nbsp; Meantime I had 
formed a firm resolution to quit Miss Wooler and her concerns for ever; but
just before I went away, she took me to her room, and giving way to her 
<!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
79</span>feelings, which in general she restrains far too rigidly, gave me 
to understand that in spite of her cold, repulsive manners, she had a 
considerable regard for me, and would be very sorry to part with me.&nbsp; 
If any body likes me, I cannot help liking them; and remembering that she 
had in general been very kind to me, I gave in and said I would come back 
if she wished me.&nbsp; So we are settled again for the present, but I am 
not satisfied.&nbsp; I should have respected her far more if she had turned
me out of doors, instead of crying for two days and two nights 
together.&nbsp; I was in a regular passion; my &ldquo;<i>warm</i> 
temper&rdquo; quite got the better of me, of which I don&rsquo;t boast, for
it was a weakness; nor am I ashamed of it, for I had reason to be 
angry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anne is now much better, though she still requires a great deal 
of care.&nbsp; However, I am relieved from my worst fears respecting 
her.&nbsp; I approve highly of the plan you mention, except as it regards 
committing a verse of the Psalms to memory.&nbsp; I do not see the direct 
advantage to be derived from that.&nbsp; We have entered on a new 
year.&nbsp; Will it be stained as darkly as the last with all our sins, 
follies, secret vanities, and uncontrolled passions and propensities?&nbsp;
I trust not; but I feel in nothing better, neither humbler nor purer.&nbsp;
It will want three weeks next Monday to the termination of the 
holidays.&nbsp; Come to see me, my dear Ellen, as soon as you can; however 
bitterly I sometimes feel towards other people, the recollection of your 
mild, steady friendship consoles and softens me.&nbsp; I am glad you are 
not such a passionate fool as myself.&nbsp; Give my best love to your 
mother and sisters.&nbsp; Excuse the most hideous scrawl that ever was 
penned, and&mdash;Believe me always tenderly yours,</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. Bront&euml;</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dewsbury Moor, however, did not agree with Charlotte.&nbsp; That was 
probably the core of the matter.&nbsp; She returned to Haworth, but only to
look around for another &lsquo;situation.&rsquo;&nbsp; This time she 
accepted the position of private governess in the family of a Mr. Sidgwick,
at Stonegappe, in the same county.&nbsp; Her letters from his house require
no comment.&nbsp; A sentence from the first was quoted by Mrs. Gaskell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>TO MISS EMILY J. BRONT&Euml;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Stonegappe</span>, 
<i>June</i> 8<i>th</i>, 1839.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dearest Lavinia</span>,&mdash;I am most 
exceedingly obliged to you for the trouble you have taken in seeking up my 
things and sending them all right.&nbsp; The box and its contents were most
acceptable.&nbsp; I only wish I had asked you to send me some 
letter-paper.&nbsp; This is my last sheet but two.&nbsp; When you can send 
the other articles of raiment now manufacturing, I shall be right down glad
of them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have striven hard to be pleased with my new situation.&nbsp; 
The country, the house, and the grounds are, as I have said, divine.&nbsp; 
But, alack-a-day! there is such a thing as seeing all beautiful around 
you&mdash;pleasant woods, winding white paths, green lawns, and blue 
sunshiny sky&mdash;and not having a free moment or a free thought left to 
enjoy them in.&nbsp; The children are constantly with me, and more riotous,
perverse, unmanageable cubs never grew.&nbsp; As for correcting them, I 
soon quickly found that was entirely out of the question: they are to do as
they like.&nbsp; A complaint to Mrs. Sidgwick brings only black looks upon 
oneself, and unjust, partial excuses to screen the children.&nbsp; I have 
tried that plan once.&nbsp; It succeeded so notably that I shall try it no 
more.&nbsp; I said in my last letter that Mrs. Sidgwick did not know 
me.&nbsp; I now begin to find that she does not intend to know me, that she
cares nothing in the world about me except to contrive how the greatest 
possible quantity of labour may be squeezed out of me, and to that end she 
overwhelms me with oceans of needlework, yards of cambric to hem, muslin 
night-caps to make, and, above all things, dolls to dress.&nbsp; I do not 
think she likes me at all, because I can&rsquo;t help being shy in such an 
entirely novel scene, surrounded as I have hitherto been by strange and 
constantly changing faces.&nbsp; I see now more clearly than I have ever 
done before that a private governess has no existence, is not considered as
a living and rational being except as connected with the wearisome duties 
she has to fulfil.&nbsp; While she is teaching the children, working for 
them, amusing them, it is all right.&nbsp; If she steals a moment for 
herself she is a nuisance.&nbsp; <!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>Nevertheless, Mrs. Sidgwick is universally 
considered an amiable woman.&nbsp; Her manners are fussily affable.&nbsp; 
She talks a great deal, but as it seems to me not much to the 
purpose.&nbsp; Perhaps I may like her better after a while.&nbsp; At 
present I have no call to her.&nbsp; Mr. Sidgwick is in my opinion a 
hundred times better&mdash;less profession, less bustling condescension, 
but a far kinder heart.&nbsp; It is very seldom that he speaks to me, but 
when he does I always feel happier and more settled for some minutes 
after.&nbsp; He never asks me to wipe the children&rsquo;s smutty noses or 
tie their shoes or fetch their pinafores or set them a chair.&nbsp; One of 
the pleasantest afternoons I have spent here&mdash;indeed, the only one at 
all pleasant&mdash;was when Mr. Sidgwick walked out with his children, and 
I had orders to follow a little behind.&nbsp; As he strolled on through his
fields with his magnificent Newfoundland dog at his side, he looked very 
like what a frank, wealthy, Conservative gentleman ought to be.&nbsp; He 
spoke freely and unaffectedly to the people he met, and though he indulged 
his children and allowed them to tease himself far too much, he would not 
suffer them grossly to insult others.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am getting quite to have a regard for the Carter family.&nbsp; 
At home I should not care for them, but here they are friends.&nbsp; Mr. 
Carter was at Mirfield yesterday and saw Anne.&nbsp; He says she was 
looking uncommonly well.&nbsp; Poor girl, <i>she</i> must indeed wish to be
at home.&nbsp; As to Mrs. Collins&rsquo; report that Mrs. Sidgwick intended
to keep me permanently, I do not think that such was ever her design.&nbsp;
Moreover, I would not stay without some alterations.&nbsp; For instance, 
this burden of sewing would have to be removed.&nbsp; It is too bad for 
anything.&nbsp; I never in my whole life had my time so fully taken 
up.&nbsp; Next week we are going to Swarcliffe, Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s place
near Harrogate, to stay three weeks or a month.&nbsp; After that time I 
hope Miss Hoby will return.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t show this letter to papa or 
aunt, only to Branwell.&nbsp; They will think I am never satisfied wherever
I am.&nbsp; I complain to you because it is a relief, and really I have had
some unexpected mortifications to put up with.&nbsp; However, things may 
mend, but Mrs. <!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>Sidgwick expects me to do things that I cannot do&mdash;to love 
her children and be entirely devoted to them.&nbsp; I am really very 
well.&nbsp; I am so sleepy that I can write no more.&nbsp; I must leave 
off.&nbsp; Love to all.&mdash;Good-bye.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Direct your next dispatch&mdash;J. Greenwood, Esq., Swarcliffe, 
near Harrogate.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Swarcliffe</span>, 
<i>June</i> 15<i>th</i>, 1839.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dearest Ellen</span>,&mdash;I am writing a
letter to you with pencil because I cannot just now procure ink without 
going into the drawing-room, where I do not wish to go.&nbsp; I only 
received your letter yesterday, for we are not now residing at Stonegappe 
but at Swarcliffe, a summer residence of Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s, Mrs. 
Sidgwick&rsquo;s father; it is near Harrogate and Ripon.&nbsp; I should 
have written to you long since, and told you every detail of the utterly 
new scene into which I have lately been cast, had I not been daily 
expecting a letter from yourself, and wondering and lamenting that you did 
not write, for you will remember it was your turn.&nbsp; I must not bother 
you too much with my sorrows, of which, I fear, you have heard an 
exaggerated account.&nbsp; If you were near me, perhaps I might be tempted 
to tell you all, to grow egotistical, and pour out the long history of a 
private governess&rsquo;s trials and crosses in her first situation.&nbsp; 
As it is, I will only ask you to imagine the miseries of a reserved wretch 
like me thrown at once into the midst of a large family, proud as peacocks 
and wealthy as Jews, at a time when they were particularly gay, when the 
house was filled with company&mdash;all strangers: people whose faces I had
never seen before.&nbsp; In this state I had a charge given of a set of 
horrid children, whom I was expected constantly to amuse, as well as 
instruct.&nbsp; I soon found that the constant demand on my stock of animal
spirits reduced them to the lowest state of exhaustion; at times I 
felt&mdash;and, I suppose seemed&mdash;depressed.&nbsp; To my astonishment,
I was taken to task on the subject by Mrs. Sidgwick, with a sternness of 
manner and a harshness of language scarcely credible.&nbsp; Like a fool, I 
cried most bitterly.&nbsp; I could not help it; my spirits quite failed me 
at first.&nbsp; <!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>I thought I had done my best, strained every 
nerve to please her; and to be treated in that way, merely because I was 
shy and sometimes melancholy, was too bad.&nbsp; At first I was for giving 
all up and going home.&nbsp; But after a little reflection, I determined to
summon what energy I had, and to weather the storm.&nbsp; I said to myself,
&ldquo;I had never yet quitted a place without gaining a friend; adversity 
is a good school; the poor are born to labour, and the dependent to 
endure.&rdquo;&nbsp; I resolved to be patient, to command my feelings, and 
to take what came; the ordeal, I reflected, would not last many weeks, and 
I trusted it would do me good.&nbsp; I recollected the fable of the willow 
and the oak; I bent quietly, and now I trust the storm is blowing 
over.&nbsp; Mrs. Sidgwick is generally considered an agreeable woman; so 
she is, I doubt not, in general society.&nbsp; Her health is sound, her 
animal spirits good, consequently she is cheerful in company.&nbsp; But oh!
does this compensate for the absence of every fine feeling, of every gentle
and delicate sentiment?&nbsp; She behaves somewhat more civilly to me now 
than she did at first, and the children are a little more manageable; but 
she does not know my character, and she does not wish to know it.&nbsp; I 
have never had five minutes conversation with her since I came, except when
she was scolding me.&nbsp; I have no wish to be pitied, except by 
yourself.&nbsp; If I were talking to you I could tell you much more.&nbsp; 
Good-bye, dear, dear Ellen.&nbsp; Write to me again very soon, and tell me 
how you are.</p>

I&rsquo;ll trouble you with no complaints at present.&nbsp; Write to me

<p>That experience with the Sidgwicks rankled for many a <!-- page 84--><a 
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>day, and we find 
Charlotte Bront&euml; referring to it in her letters from Brussels.&nbsp; 
At the same time it is not necessary to assume any very serious inhumanity 
on the part of the Sidgwicks or their successors the Whites, to whom 
Charlotte was indebted for her second term as private governess.&nbsp; Hers
was hardly a temperament adapted for that docile part, and one thinks of 
the author of <i>Villette</i>, and the possessor of one of the most 
vigorous prose styles in our language, condemned to a perpetual manufacture
of night-caps, with something like a shudder.&nbsp; And at the same time it
may be urged that Charlotte Bront&euml; did not suffer in vain, and that 
through her the calling of a nursery governess may have received some added
measure of dignity and consideration on the part of sister-women.</p>
<p>A month or two later we find Charlotte dealing with the subject in a 
letter to Ellen Nussey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>January</i> 24<i>th</i>, 1840.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;You could never 
live in an unruly, violent family of modern children, such for instance as 
those at Blake Hall.&nbsp; Anne is not to return.&nbsp; Mrs. Ingham is a 
placid, mild woman; but as for the children, it was one struggle of 
life-wearing exertion to keep them in anything like decent order.&nbsp; I 
am miserable when I allow myself to dwell on the necessity of spending my 
life as a governess.&nbsp; The chief requisite for that station seems to me
to be the power of taking things easily as they come, and of making oneself
comfortable and at home wherever we may chance to be&mdash;qualities in 
which all our family are singularly deficient.&nbsp; I know I cannot live 
with a person like Mrs. Sidgwick, but I hope all women are not like her, 
and my motto is &ldquo;try again.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mary Taylor, I am sorry to

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Nell</span>,&mdash;It is twelve 
o&rsquo;clock at night, but I must just write to you a word before I go to 
bed.&nbsp; If you think I am going to refuse your invitation, or if you 
sent it me with that idea, you&rsquo;re mistaken.&nbsp; As soon as I read 
your shabby little note, I gathered up my spirits directly, walked on the 
impulse of the moment into Mrs. White&rsquo;s presence, popped the 
question, and for two minutes received no answer.&nbsp; Will she refuse me 
when I work so hard for her? thought I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye-e-es&rdquo; was 
said in a reluctant, cold tone.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you, m&rsquo;am,&rdquo; 
said I, with extreme cordiality, and was marching from the room when she 
recalled me with: &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go on Saturday afternoon then, 
when the children have holiday, and if you return in time for them to have 
all their lessons on Monday morning, I don&rsquo;t see that much will be 
lost.&rdquo;&nbsp; You <i>are</i> a genuine Turk, thought I, but again I 
assented.&nbsp; Saturday after next, then, is the day 
appointed&mdash;<i>not next Saturday</i>, <i>mind</i>.&nbsp; I do not quite
know whether the offer about the gig is not entirely out of your own head 
or if George has given his consent to it&mdash;whether that consent has not
been wrung from him by the most persevering and irresistible teasing on the
part of a certain young person of my acquaintance.&nbsp; I make no manner 
of doubt that if he does send the conveyance (as Miss Wooler used to 
denominate all wheeled vehicles) it will be to his own extreme detriment 
and inconvenience, but for once in my life I&rsquo;ll not mind this, or 
bother my head about it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come&mdash;God knows with a 
thankful and joyful heart&mdash;glad of a day&rsquo;s reprieve from 
labour.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t send the gig I&rsquo;ll walk.&nbsp; Now 
mind, I am not coming to Brookroyd with the idea of dissuading Mary Taylor 
from going to New Zealand.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve said everything I mean to say 
on that subject, and she has a perfect right to decide for herself.&nbsp; I
am coming to taste the pleasure of liberty, a bit of pleasant congenial 
talk, and a <!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

want to see you again.&nbsp; Huzza for Saturday afternoon after next!&nbsp;

<p>&lsquo;Have you lit your pipe with Mr. Weightman&rsquo;s 
valentine?&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Upperwood 
House</span>, <i>May</i> 4<i>th</i>, 1841.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Nell</span>,&mdash;I have been a long 
time without writing to you; but I think, knowing as you do how I am 
situated in the matter of time, you will not be angry with me.&nbsp; Your 
brother George will have told you that he did not go into the house when we
arrived at Rawdon, for which omission of his Mrs. White was very near 
blowing me up.&nbsp; She went quite red in the face with vexation when she 
heard that the gentleman had just driven within the gates and then back 
again, for she is very touchy in the matter of opinion.&nbsp; Mr. White 
also seemed to regret the circumstance from more hospitable and kindly 
motives.&nbsp; I assure you, if you were to come and see me you would have 
quite a fuss made over you.&nbsp; During the last three weeks that hideous 
operation called &ldquo;a thorough clean&rdquo; has been going on in the 
house.&nbsp; It is now nearly completed, for which I thank my stars, as 
during its progress I have fulfilled the twofold character of nurse and 
governess, while the nurse has been transmuted into cook and 
housemaid.&nbsp; That nurse, by-the-bye, is the prettiest lass you ever 
saw, and when dressed has much more the air of a lady than her 
mistress.&nbsp; Well can I believe that Mrs. White has been an 
exciseman&rsquo;s daughter, and I am convinced also that Mr. White&rsquo;s 
extraction is very low.&nbsp; Yet Mrs. White talks in an amusing strain of 
pomposity about his and her family and connections, and affects to look 
down with wondrous hauteur on the whole race of tradesfolk, as she terms 
men of business.&nbsp; I was beginning to think Mrs. White a good sort of 
body in spite of all her bouncing and boasting, her bad grammar and worse 
orthography, but I have had experience of one little trait in her character
which condemns her a long way with me.&nbsp; After treating a person in the
most familiar terms of equality for a long time, if any little thing goes 
wrong she does <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>not scruple to give way to anger in a very coarse, unladylike 
manner.&nbsp; I think passion is the true test of vulgarity or 
refinement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This place looks exquisitely beautiful just now.&nbsp; The 
grounds are certainly lovely, and all is as green as an emerald.&nbsp; I 
wish you would just come and look at it.&nbsp; Mrs. White would be as proud
as Punch to show it you.&nbsp; Mr. White has been writing an urgent 
invitation to papa, entreating him to come and spend a week here.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t at all wish papa to come, it would be like incurring an 
obligation.&nbsp; Somehow, I have managed to get a good deal more control 
over the children lately&mdash;this makes my life a good deal easier; also,
by dint of nursing the fat baby, it has got to know me and be fond of 
me.&nbsp; I suspect myself of growing rather fond of it.&nbsp; Exertion of 
any kind is always beneficial.&nbsp; Come and see me if you can in any way 
get, I <i>want</i> to see you.&nbsp; It seems Martha Taylor is fairly 
gone.&nbsp; Good-bye, my lassie.&mdash;Yours insufferably,</p>

&lsquo;<i>May</i> 9<i>th</i>, 1841.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am about to employ 
part of a Sunday evening in answering your last letter.&nbsp; You will 
perhaps think this hardly right, and yet I do not feel that I am doing 
wrong.&nbsp; Sunday evening is almost my only time of leisure.&nbsp; No one
would blame me if I were to spend this spare hour in a pleasant chat with a
friend&mdash;is it worse to spend it in a friendly letter?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have just seen my little noisy charges deposited snugly in 
their cribs, and I am sitting alone in the school-room with the quiet of a 
Sunday evening pervading the grounds and gardens outside my window.&nbsp; I
owe you a letter&mdash;can I choose a better time than the present for 
paying my debt?&nbsp; Now, Mr. Nussey, you need not expect any gossip or 
news, I have none to tell you&mdash;even if I had I am not at present in 
the mood to communicate them.&nbsp; You will excuse an unconnected 
letter.&nbsp; If I had thought you critical or captious I would have 
declined the task of corresponding with you.&nbsp; When I reflect, indeed, 
it <!-- page 88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
88</span>seems strange that I should sit down to write without a feeling of
formality and restraint to an individual with whom I am personally so 
little acquainted as I am with yourself; but the fact is, I cannot be 
formal in a letter&mdash;if I write at all I must write as I think.&nbsp; 
It seems Ellen has told you that I am become a governess again.&nbsp; As 
you say, it is indeed a hard thing for flesh and blood to leave home, 
especially a <i>good</i> home&mdash;not a wealthy or splendid one.&nbsp; My
home is humble and unattractive to strangers, but to me it contains what I 
shall find nowhere else in the world&mdash;the profound, the intense 
affection which brothers and sisters feel for each other when their minds 
are cast in the same mould, their ideas drawn from the same 
source&mdash;when they have clung to each other from childhood, and when 
disputes have never sprung up to divide them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are all separated now, and winning our bread amongst strangers
as we can&mdash;my sister Anne is near York, my brother in a situation near
Halifax, I am here.&nbsp; Emily is the only one left at home, where her 
usefulness and willingness make her indispensable.&nbsp; Under these 
circumstances should we repine?&nbsp; I think not&mdash;our mutual 
affection ought to comfort us under all difficulties.&nbsp; If the God on 
whom we must all depend will but vouchsafe us health and the power to 
continue in the strict line of duty, so as never under any temptation to 
swerve from it an inch, we shall have ample reason to be grateful and 
contented.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not pretend to say that I am always contented.&nbsp; A 
governess must often submit to have the heartache.&nbsp; My employers, Mr. 
and Mrs. White, are kind worthy people in their way, but the children are 
indulged.&nbsp; I have great difficulties to contend with sometimes.&nbsp; 
Perseverance will perhaps conquer them.&nbsp; And it has gratified me much 
to find that the parents are well satisfied with their children&rsquo;s 
improvement in learning since I came.&nbsp; But I am dwelling too much upon
my own concerns and feelings.&nbsp; It is true they are interesting to me, 
but it is wholly impossible they should be so to you, and, therefore, I 
hope you will skip the last page, for I repent having written it.</p>

89</span>&lsquo;A fortnight since I had a letter from Ellen urging me to go
to Brookroyd for a single day.&nbsp; I felt such a longing to have a 
respite from labour, and to get once more amongst &ldquo;old familiar 
faces,&rdquo; that I conquered diffidence and asked Mrs. White to let me 
go.&nbsp; She complied, and I went accordingly, and had a most delightful 
holiday.&nbsp; I saw your mother, your sisters Mercy, Ellen, and poor 
Sarah, and your brothers Richard and George&mdash;all were well.&nbsp; 
Ellen talked of endeavouring to get a situation somewhere.&nbsp; I did not 
encourage the idea much.&nbsp; I advised her rather to go to Earnley for a 
while.&nbsp; I think she wants a change, and I dare say you would be glad 
to have her as a companion for a few months.&mdash;I remain, yours

<p>The above letter was written to Miss Nussey&rsquo;s brother, whose 
attachment to Charlotte Bront&euml; has already more than once been 
mentioned in the current biographies.&nbsp; The following letter to Miss 
Nussey is peculiarly interesting because of the reference to Ireland.&nbsp;
It would have been strange if Charlotte Bront&euml; had returned as a 
governess to her father&rsquo;s native land.&nbsp; Speculation thereon is 
sufficiently foolish, and yet one is tempted to ask if Ireland might not 
have gained some of that local literary colour&mdash;one of its greatest 
needs&mdash;which always makes Scotland dear to the readers of 
<i>Waverley</i>, and Yorkshire classic ground to the admirers of 
<i>Shirley</i>.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Nell</span>,&mdash;If I don&rsquo;t 
scrawl you a line of some sort I know you will begin to fancy that I 
neglect you, in spite of all I said last time we met.&nbsp; You can hardly 
fancy it possible, I dare say, that I cannot find a quarter of an hour to 
scribble a note in; but when a note is written it is to be carried a mile 
to the post, and consumes nearly an hour, which is a large portion of the 
day.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. White have been gone a week.&nbsp; I heard from 
them this morning; they are now at Hexham.&nbsp; No <!-- page 90--><a 
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>time is fixed for their
return, but I hope it will not be delayed long, or I shall miss the chance 
of seeing Anne this vacation.&nbsp; She came home, I understand, last 
Wednesday, and is only to be allowed three weeks&rsquo; holidays, because 
the family she is with are going to Scarborough.&nbsp; I should like to see
her to judge for myself of the state of her health.&nbsp; I cannot trust 
any other person&rsquo;s report, no one seems minute enough in their 
observations.&nbsp; I should also very much have liked you to see her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have got on very well with the servants and children so far, 
yet it is dreary, solitary work.&nbsp; You can tell as well as me the 
lonely feeling of being without a companion.&nbsp; I offered the Irish 
concern to Mary Taylor, but she is so circumstanced that she cannot accept 
it.&nbsp; Her brothers have a feeling of pride that revolts at the thought 
of their sister &ldquo;going out.&rdquo;&nbsp; I hardly knew that it was 
such a degradation till lately.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your visit did me much good.&nbsp; I wish Mary Taylor would come,

<p>It must have been during this holiday that the resolution concerning a 
school of their own assumed definite shape.&nbsp; Miss Wooler talked of 
giving up Dewsbury Moor&mdash;should Charlotte and Emily take it?&nbsp;

letter.&nbsp; I am not going to Dewsbury Moor, as far as I can see at

Dewsbury Moor is a poisoned place to me; besides, I burn to go somewhere 
else.&nbsp; I think, Nell, I see a chance of getting to Brussels.&nbsp;

letters but I have received no letters in reply yet.&nbsp; Belgium is a 
long way off, and people are everywhere hard to spur up to the proper 
speed.&nbsp; Mary Taylor says we can scarcely expect to get off before 
January.&nbsp; I have wished and intended to write to both Anne and 
Branwell, but really I have not had time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Jenkins I find was mistakenly termed the British Consul at 
Brussels; he is in fact the English Episcopal clergyman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think perhaps we shall find that the best plan will be for papa
to write a letter to him by and bye, but not yet.&nbsp; I will give an 
intimation when this should be done, and also some idea of what had best be
said.&nbsp; Grieve not over Dewsbury Moor.&nbsp; You were cut out there to 
all intents and purposes, so in fact was Anne, Miss Wooler would hear of 
neither for the first half year.</p>

trust she will derive her full share of benefit from it in the end.&nbsp; I
exhort all to hope.&nbsp; I believe in my heart this is acting for the 
best, my only fear is lest others should doubt and be dismayed.&nbsp; 
Before our half year in Brussels is completed, you and I will have to seek 
employment abroad.&nbsp; It is not my intention to retrace my steps home

scholastic accomplishments by a sojourn in Brussels, our literature would 
have lost that powerful novel <i>Villette</i>, and the singularly charming 
<i>Professor</i>.&nbsp; The impulse came from the persuasion that without 
&lsquo;languages&rsquo; the school project was an entirely hopeless 
one.&nbsp; Mary and Martha Taylor were at Brussels, staying with friends, 
and thence they had sent kindly presents to Charlotte, at this time raging 
under the yoke of governess at Upperwood House.&nbsp; Charlotte wrote the 
diplomatic letter to her aunt which ended so satisfactorily. <a 
name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96" class="citation">[96]</a>&nbsp;
<!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>The 
good lady&mdash;Miss Branwell was then about sixty years of 
age&mdash;behaved handsomely by her nieces, and it was agreed that 
Charlotte and Emily were to go to the Continent, Anne retaining her post of
governess with Mrs. Robinson at Thorp Green.&nbsp; But Brussels schools did
not seem at the first blush to be very satisfactory.&nbsp; Something better
promised at Lille.</p>
<p>Here is a letter written at this period of hesitation and doubt.&nbsp; A
portion of it only was printed by Mrs. Gaskell.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>January</i> 20<i>th</i>, 1842.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I cannot quite enter
into your friends&rsquo; reasons for not permitting you to come to Haworth;
but as it is at present, and in all human probability will be for an 
indefinite time to come, impossible for me to get to Brookroyd, the balance
of accounts is not so unequal as it might otherwise be.&nbsp; We expect to 
leave England in less than three weeks, but we are not yet certain of the 
day, as it will depend upon the convenience of a French lady now in London,
Madame Marzials, under whose escort we are to sail.&nbsp; Our place of 
destination is changed.&nbsp; Papa received an unfavourable account from 
Mr. or rather Mrs. Jenkins of the French schools in Brussels, and on 
further inquiry, an Institution in Lille, in the North of France, was 
recommended by Baptist Noel and other clergymen, and to that place it is 
decided that we are to go.&nbsp; The terms are fifty pounds for each pupil 
for board and French alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I considered it kind in aunt to consent to an extra sum for a 
separate room.&nbsp; We shall find it a great privilege in many ways.&nbsp;
I regret the change from Brussels to Lille on many accounts, chiefly that I
shall not see Martha Taylor.&nbsp; Mary has been indefatigably kind in 
providing me with information.&nbsp; She has grudged no labour, and 
scarcely any expense, to that end.&nbsp; Mary&rsquo;s price is above 
rubies.&nbsp; I have, in fact, two friends&mdash;you and her&mdash;staunch 
and true, in whose faith and sincerity I have as strong a belief as I have 
in the Bible.&nbsp; I have bothered you both, you especially; but you 
always get the tongs and heap coals of fire upon my head.&nbsp; I have had 
letters to write lately to Brussels, to Lille, and to London.&nbsp; I have 
lots of chemises, night-gowns, pocket-handkerchiefs, and pockets to make, 
besides clothes to repair.&nbsp; I have been, every week since I came home,
expecting to see Branwell, and he has never been able to get over 
yet.&nbsp; We fully expect him, however, next Saturday.&nbsp; Under these 
circumstances how can I go visiting?&nbsp; You tantalise me to death with 
talking of conversations by the fireside.&nbsp; Depend upon it, we are not 
to have <!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
99</span>any such for many a long month to come.&nbsp; I get an interesting
impression of old age upon my face, and when you see me next I shall 
certainly wear caps and spectacles.&mdash;Yours affectionately,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;C. B.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Mr. Jenkins was chaplain to the British Embassy at Brussels, and 
not Consul, as Charlotte at first supposed.&nbsp; The brother of his wife 
was a clergyman living in the neighbourhood of Haworth.&nbsp; Mr. Jenkins, 
whose English Episcopal chapel Charlotte attended during her stay in 
Brussels, finally recommended the Pensionnat H&eacute;ger in the Rue 
d&rsquo;Isabelle.&nbsp; Madame H&eacute;ger wrote, accepting the two girls 
as pupils, and to Brussels their father escorted them in February 1842, 
staying one night at the house of Mr. Jenkins and then returning to 
Haworth.</p>
<p>The life of Charlotte Bront&euml; at Brussels has been mirrored for us 
with absolute accuracy in <i>Villette</i> and <i>The Professor</i>.&nbsp; 
That, indeed, from the point of view of local colour, is made sufficiently 
plain to the casual visitor of to-day who calls in the Rue 
d&rsquo;Isabelle.&nbsp; The house, it is true, is dismantled with a view to
its incorporation into some city buildings in the background, but one may 
still eat pears from the &lsquo;old and huge fruit-trees&rsquo; which 
flourished when Charlotte and Emily walked under them half a century ago; 
one may still wander through the school-rooms, the long dormitories, and 
into the &lsquo;vine-draped <i>berceau</i>&rsquo;&mdash;little enough is 
changed within and without.&nbsp; Here is the dormitory with its twenty 
beds, the two end ones being occupied by Emily and Charlotte, they alone 
securing the privilege of age or English eccentricity to curtain off their 
beds from the gaze of the eighteen girls who shared the room with 
them.&nbsp; The crucifix, indeed, has been removed from the niche in the 
<i>Oratoire</i> where the children offered up prayer every morning; but 
with a copy of <i>Villette</i> in hand it is possible to restore every 
feature of the place, not excluding the adjoining Athen&eacute;e with its 
small window overlooking the garden of the <!-- page 100--><a 
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>Pensionnat and the 
<i>all&eacute;e d&eacute;fendu</i>.&nbsp; It was from this window that Mr. 
Crimsworth of <i>The Professor</i> looked down upon the girls at 
play.&nbsp; It was here, indeed, at the Royal Athen&eacute;e, that M. 
H&eacute;ger was Professor of Latin.&nbsp; Externally, then, the Pensionnat
H&eacute;ger remains practically the same as it appeared to Charlotte and 
Emily Bront&euml; in February 1842, when they made their first appearance 
in Brussels.&nbsp; The Rue Fossette of <i>Villette</i>, the Rue 
d&rsquo;Isabelle of <i>The Professor</i>, is the veritable Rue 
d&rsquo;Isabelle of Currer Bell&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>What, however, shall we say of the people who wandered through these 
rooms and gardens&mdash;the hundred or more children, the three or four 
governesses, the professor and his wife?&nbsp; Here there has been much 
speculation and not a little misreading of the actual facts.&nbsp; 
Charlotte and Emily went to Brussels to learn.&nbsp; They did learn with 
energy.&nbsp; It was their first experience of foreign travel, and it came 
too late in life for them to enter into it with that breadth of mind and 
tolerance of the customs of other lands, lacking which the Englishman 
abroad is always an offence.&nbsp; Charlotte and Emily hated the land and 
people.&nbsp; They had been brought up ultra-Protestants.&nbsp; Their 
father was an Ulster man, and his one venture into the polemics of his age 
was to attack the proposals for Catholic emancipation.&nbsp; With this 
inheritance of intolerance, how could Charlotte and Emily face with 
kindliness the Romanism which they saw around them?&nbsp; How heartily they
disapproved of it many a picture in <i>Villette</i> has made plain to 
us.</p>
<p>Charlotte had been in Brussels three months when she made the friendship
to which I am indebted for anything that there may be to add to this 
episode in her life.&nbsp; Miss L&aelig;titia Wheelwright was one of five 
sisters, the daughters of a doctor in Lower Phillimore Place, 
Kensington.&nbsp; Dr. Wheelwright went to Brussels for his health and for 
his children&rsquo;s education.&nbsp; The girls were day boarders at the 
Pensionnat, but they lived in the house for a full month <!-- page 101--><a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>or more at a time 
when their father and mother were on a trip up the Rhine.&nbsp; Otherwise 
their abode was a flat in the Hotel Clusyenaar in the Rue Royale, and there
during her later stay in Brussels Charlotte frequently paid them 
visits.&nbsp; In this earlier period Charlotte and Emily were too busy with
their books to think of &lsquo;calls&rsquo; and the like frivolities, and 
it must be confessed also that at this stage L&aelig;titia Wheelwright 
would have thought it too high a price for a visit from Charlotte to 
receive as a fellow-guest the apparently unamiable Emily.&nbsp; Miss 
Wheelwright, who was herself fourteen years of age when she entered the 
Pensionnat H&eacute;ger, recalls the two sisters, thin and sallow-looking, 
pacing up and down the garden, friendless and alone.&nbsp; It was the sight
of L&aelig;titia standing up in the class-room and glancing round with a 
semi-contemptuous air at all these Belgian girls which attracted Charlotte 
Bront&euml; to her.&nbsp; &lsquo;It was so very English,&rsquo; Miss 
Bront&euml; laughingly remarked at a later period to her friend.&nbsp; 
There was one other English girl at this time of sufficient age to be 
companionable; but with Miss Maria Miller, whom Charlotte Bront&euml; has 
depicted under the guise of Ginevra Fanshawe, she had less in common.&nbsp;
In later years Miss Miller became Mrs. Robertson, the wife of an author in 
one form or another.</p>
<p>To Miss Wheelwright, and those of her sisters who are still living, the 
descriptions of the Pensionnat H&eacute;ger which are given in 
<i>Villette</i> and <i>The Professor</i> are perfectly accurate.&nbsp; M. 
H&eacute;ger, with his heavy black moustache and his black hair, entering 
the class-room of an evening to read to his pupils was a sufficiently 
familiar object, and his keen intelligence amounting almost to genius had 
affected the Wheelwright girls as forcibly as it had done the 
Bront&euml;s.&nbsp; Mme. H&eacute;ger, again, for ever peeping from behind 
doors and through the plate-glass partitions which separate the passages 
from the school-rooms, was a constant source of irritation to all <!-- page
102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>the English 
pupils.&nbsp; This prying and spying is, it is possible, more of a fine art
with the school-mistresses of the Continent than with those of our own 
land.&nbsp; In any case, Mme. H&eacute;ger was an accomplished spy, and in 
the midst of the most innocent work or recreation the pupils would suddenly
see a pair of eyes pierce the dusk and disappear.&nbsp; This, and a hundred
similar trifles, went to build up an antipathy on both sides, which had, 
however, scarcely begun when Charlotte and Emily were suddenly called home 
by their aunt&rsquo;s death in October.&nbsp; A letter to Miss Nussey on 
her return sufficiently explains the situation.</p>
<blockquote>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>,

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I was not yet 
returned to England when your letter arrived.&nbsp; We received the first 
news of aunt&rsquo;s illness, Wednesday, Nov. 2nd.&nbsp; We decided to come
home directly.&nbsp; Next morning a second letter informed us of her 
death.&nbsp; We sailed from Antwerp on Sunday; we travelled day and night 
and got home on Tuesday morning&mdash;and of course the funeral and all was
over.&nbsp; We shall see her no more.&nbsp; Papa is pretty well.&nbsp; We 
found Anne at home; she is pretty well also.&nbsp; You say you have had no 
letter from me for a long time.&nbsp; I wrote to you three weeks ago.&nbsp;
When you answer this note, I will write to you more in detail.&nbsp; Aunt, 
Martha Taylor, and Mr. Weightman are now all gone; how dreary and void 
everything seems.&nbsp; Mr. Weightman&rsquo;s illness was exactly what 
Martha&rsquo;s was&mdash;he was ill the same length of time and died in the
same manner.&nbsp; Aunt&rsquo;s disease was internal obstruction; she also 
was ill a fortnight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-bye, my dear Ellen.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The aunt whose sudden death brought Charlotte and Emily Bront&euml; thus
hastily from Brussels to Haworth must have been a very sensible woman in 
the main.&nbsp; She left her money to those of her nieces who most needed 
it.&nbsp; A perusal of her will is not without interest, and indeed it will
be <!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
103</span>seen that it clears up one or two errors into which Mrs. Gaskell 
and subsequent biographers have rashly fallen through failing to expend the
necessary half-guinea upon a copy.&nbsp; This is it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Testatrix died 29th October 1842.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now hear Mrs. Gaskell:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The small property</i>, <i>which she had accumulated by dint of 
personal frugality and self-denial</i>, <i>was bequeathed to her 
nieces</i>.&nbsp; <i>Branwell</i>, <i>her darling</i>, <i>was to have had 
his share</i>, <i>but his reckless expenditure had distressed the good old 
lady</i>, <i>and his name was omitted in her will</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A perusal of the will in question indicates that it was made in 1833, 
before Branwell had paid his first visit to London, and when, as all his 
family supposed, he was on the high road to fame and fortune as an 
artist.&nbsp; The old lady doubtless thought that the boy would be able to 
take <!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
105</span>good care of himself.&nbsp; She had, indeed, other nieces down in
Cornwall, but with the general sympathy of her friends and relatives in 
Penzance, Elizabeth Jane Kingston, who it was thought would want it most, 
was to have a share.&nbsp; Had the Kingston girl, her mother, and the 
Bront&euml; girls all died before him, the boy Branwell, it will be seen, 
would have shared the property with his Branwell cousins in Penzance, of 
whom two are still alive.&nbsp; In any case, Branwell&rsquo;s name was 
mentioned, and he received &lsquo;my Japan dressing-box,&rsquo; whatever 
that may have been worth.</p>
<p>Three or four letters, above and beyond these already published, were 
written by Charlotte to her friend in the interval between Miss 
Branwell&rsquo;s death and her return to Brussels; and she paid a visit to 
Miss Nussey at Brookroyd, and it was returned.</p>

attendance.&nbsp; Papa desires his compliments to you, and says he should 
be very glad if you could give us your company at Haworth a little

because Anne leaves us to return to York on Monday, and she wishes very 
much to see you before her departure.&nbsp; I think your brother is too 
good-natured to object to your coming.&nbsp; There is little enough 
pleasure in this world, and it would be truly unkind to deny to you and me

leave England, I will not be too delicate and ceremonious and so let the 
present opportunity pass.&nbsp; Something says to me that it will not be 
too convenient to have a guest at Brookroyd while there is an invalid 
there&mdash;however, I listen to no such suggestions.&nbsp; Anne leaves 
Haworth on Tuesday at 6 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and we should reach 
Bradford at half-past eight.&nbsp; There are many reasons why I should have
preferred your coming to Haworth, but as it appears there are always 
obstacles which prevent that, I&rsquo;ll break through ceremony, or pride,

or whether it is considered improper for a young lady to mention the 
gentlemen of a house.&nbsp; We have been one walk on the moors since you

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;C. B.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This second visit of Charlotte Bront&euml; to Brussels has given rise to
much speculation, some of it of not the <!-- page 108--><a 
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>pleasantest 
kind.&nbsp; It is well to face the point bluntly, for it has been more than
once implied that Charlotte Bront&euml; was in love with M. H&eacute;ger, 
as her prototype Lucy Snowe was in love with Paul Emanuel.&nbsp; The 
assumption, which is absolutely groundless, has had certain plausible 
points in its favour, not the least obvious, of course, being the 
inclination to read autobiography into every line of Charlotte 
Bront&euml;&rsquo;s writings.&nbsp; Then there is a passage in a printed 
letter to Miss Nussey which has been quoted as if to bear out this 
suggestion: &lsquo;I returned to Brussels after aunt&rsquo;s death,&rsquo; 
she writes, &lsquo;against my conscience, prompted by what then seemed an 
irresistible impulse.&nbsp; I was punished for my selfish folly by a total 
withdrawal for more than two years of happiness and peace of 
mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is perfectly excusable for a man of the world, unacquainted with 
qualifying facts, to assume that for these two years Charlotte 
Bront&euml;&rsquo;s heart was consumed with an unquenchable love for her 
professor&mdash;held in restraint, no doubt, as the most censorious admit, 
but sufficiently marked to secure the jealousy and ill-will of Madame 
H&eacute;ger.&nbsp; Madame H&eacute;ger and her family, it must be 
admitted, have kept this impression afloat.&nbsp; Madame H&eacute;ger 
refused to see Mrs. Gaskell when she called upon her in the Rue 
d&rsquo;Isabelle; and her daughters will tell you that their father broke 
off his correspondence with Miss Bront&euml; because his favourite English 
pupil showed an undue extravagance of devotion.&nbsp; &lsquo;Her attachment
after her return to Yorkshire,&rsquo; to quote a recent essay on the 
subject, &lsquo;was expressed in her frequent letters in a tone that her 
Brussels friends considered it not only prudent but kind to check.&nbsp; 
She was warned by them that the exaltation these letters betrayed needed to
be toned down and replaced by what was reasonable.&nbsp; She was further 
advised to write only once in six months, and then to limit the subject of 
her letters to her own health and that of her family, and to a plain 
account of her circumstances <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>and occupations.&rsquo; <a 
name="citation109a"></a><a href="#footnote109a" 
class="citation">[109a]</a>&nbsp; Now to all this I do not hesitate to give
an emphatic contradiction, a contradiction based upon the only independent 
authority available.&nbsp; Miss L&aelig;titia Wheelwright and her sisters 
saw much of Charlotte Bront&euml; during this second sojourn in Brussels, 
and they have a quite different tale to tell.&nbsp; That misgiving of 
Charlotte, by the way, which weighed so heavily upon her mind afterwards, 
was due to the fact that she had left her father practically unprotected 
from the enticing company of a too festive curate.&nbsp; He gave himself up
at this time to a very copious whisky drinking, from which 
Charlotte&rsquo;s home-coming speedily rescued him. <a 
name="citation109b"></a><a href="#footnote109b" 
class="citation">[109b]</a></p>
<p>Madame H&eacute;ger did indeed hate Charlotte Bront&euml; in her later 
years.&nbsp; This is not unnatural when we remember how that unfortunate 
woman has been gibbeted for all time in the characters of Mlle. 
Zora&iuml;de Reuter and Madame Beck.&nbsp; But in justice to the creator of
these scathing portraits, it may be mentioned that Charlotte Bront&euml; 
took every precaution to prevent <i>Villette</i> from obtaining currency in
the city which inspired it.&nbsp; She told Miss Wheelwright, with whom 
naturally, on her visits to London, she often discussed the Brussels life, 
that she had received a promise that there should be no translation, and 
that the book would never appear in the French language.&nbsp; One cannot 
therefore fix upon Charlotte Bront&euml; any responsibility for the 
circumstance that immediately after her death the novel appeared in the 
only tongue understood by Madame H&eacute;ger.</p>
<p>Miss Wheelwright informs me that Charlotte Bront&euml; did certainly 
admire M. H&eacute;ger, as did all his pupils, very heartily.&nbsp; 
Charlotte&rsquo;s first impression, indeed, was not flattering: &lsquo;He 
is professor of rhetoric, a man of power as to mind, but <!-- page 110--><a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>very choleric and 
irritable in temperament; a little black being, with a face that varies in 
expression.&nbsp; Sometimes he borrows the lineaments of an insane tom-cat,
sometimes those of a delirious hyena; occasionally, but very seldom, he 
discards these perilous attractions and assumes an air not above 100 
degrees removed from mild and gentleman-like.&rsquo;&nbsp; But he was 
particularly attentive to Charlotte; and as he was the first really 
intelligent man she had met, the first man, that is to say, with 
intellectual interests&mdash;for we know how much she despised the curates 
of her neighbourhood&mdash;she rejoiced at every opportunity of doing 
verbal battle with him, for Charlotte inherited, it may be said, the Irish 
love of debate.&nbsp; Some time after Charlotte had returned to England, 
and when in the height of her fame, she met her Brussels school-fellow in 
London.&nbsp; Miss Wheelwright asked her whether she still corresponded 
with M. H&eacute;ger.&nbsp; Charlotte replied that she had discontinued to 
do so.&nbsp; M. H&eacute;ger had mentioned in one letter that his wife did 
not like the correspondence, and he asked her therefore to address her 
letters to the Royal Athen&eacute;e, where, as I have mentioned, he gave 
lessons to the boys.&nbsp; &lsquo;I stopped writing at once,&rsquo; 
Charlotte told her friend.&nbsp; &lsquo;I would not have dreamt of writing 
to him when I found it was disagreeable to his wife; certainly I would not 
write unknown to her.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;She said this,&rsquo; Miss 
Wheelwright adds, &lsquo;with the sincerity of manner which characterised 
her every utterance, and I would sooner have doubted myself than 
her.&rsquo;&nbsp; Let, then, this silly and offensive imputation be now and
for ever dismissed from the minds of Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s 
admirers, if indeed it had ever lodged there. <a name="citation110"></a><a 
href="#footnote110" class="citation">[110]</a></p>
<p><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
111</span>Charlotte had not visited the Wheelwrights in the Rue Royale 
during her first visit to Brussels.&nbsp; She had found the companionship 
of Emily all-sufficing, and Emily was not sufficiently popular with the 
Wheelwrights to have made her a welcome guest.&nbsp; They admitted her 
cleverness, but they considered her hard, unsympathetic, and abrupt in 
manner.&nbsp; We know that she was self-contained and homesick, pining for 
her native moors.&nbsp; This was not evident to a girl of ten, the youngest
of the Wheelwright children, who was compelled to receive daily a music 
lesson from Emily in her play-hours.&nbsp; When, however, Charlotte came 
back to Brussels alone she was heartily welcomed into two or three English 
families, including those of Mr. Dixon, of the Rev. Mr. Jenkins, and of Dr.
Wheelwright.&nbsp; With the Wheelwright children she sometimes spent the 
Sunday, and with them she occasionally visited the English Episcopal church
which the Wheelwrights attended, and of which the clergyman was a Mr. 
Drury.&nbsp; When Dr. Wheelwright took his wife for a Rhine trip in May he 
left his four children&mdash;one little girl had died at Brussels, aged 
seven, in the preceding November&mdash;in the care of Madame H&eacute;ger 
at the Pensionnat, and under the immediate supervision of Charlotte.</p>
<p>At this period there was plenty of cheerfulness in her life.&nbsp; She 
was learning German.&nbsp; She was giving English lessons to M. 
H&eacute;ger and to his brother-in-law, M. Chappelle.&nbsp; She went to the
Carnival, and described it &lsquo;animating to see the immense crowds and 
the general gaiety.&rsquo;&nbsp; <!-- page 112--><a 
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>&lsquo;Whenever I 
turn back,&rsquo; she writes, &lsquo;to compare what I am with what I was, 
my place here with my place at Mrs. Sidgwick&rsquo;s or Mrs. White&rsquo;s,
I am thankful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a letter to her brother, however, we find the darker side of the 
picture.&nbsp; It reveals many things apart from what is actually written 
down.&nbsp; In this, the only letter to Branwell that I have been able to 
discover, apart from one written in childhood, it appears that the brother 
and sister are upon very confidential terms.&nbsp; Up to this time, at any 
rate, Branwell&rsquo;s conduct had not excited any apprehension as to his 
future, and the absence of any substantial place in his aunt&rsquo;s will 
was clearly not due to misconduct.&nbsp; Branwell was now under the same 
roof as his sister Anne, having obtained an appointment as tutor to young 
Edmund Robinson at Thorp Green, near York, where Anne was governess.&nbsp; 
The letter is unsigned, concluding playfully with &lsquo;yourn; and the 
initials follow a closing message to Anne on the same sheet of paper.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO BRANWELL BRONT&Euml;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Brussels</span>, 
<i>May</i> 1<i>st</i>, 1843.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Branwell</span>,&mdash;I hear you have 
written a letter to me.&nbsp; This letter, however, as usual, I have never 
received, which I am exceedingly sorry for, as I have wished very much to 
hear from you.&nbsp; Are you sure that you put the right address and that 
you paid the English postage, 1s. 6d.?&nbsp; Without that, letters are 
never forwarded.&nbsp; I heard from papa a day or two since.&nbsp; All 
appears to be going on reasonably well at home.&nbsp; I grieve only that 
Emily is so solitary; but, however, you and Anne will soon be returning for
the holidays, which will cheer the house for a time.&nbsp; Are you in 
better health and spirits, and does Anne continue to be pretty well?&nbsp; 
I understand papa has been to see you.&nbsp; Did he seem cheerful and 
well?&nbsp; Mind when you write to me you answer these questions, as I wish
to know.&nbsp; Also give me a detailed account as to how you get on with 
your pupil and the rest of the family.&nbsp; I have received a general <!--
page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
113</span>assurance that you do well and are in good odour, but I want to 
know particulars.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As for me, I am very well and wag on as usual.&nbsp; I perceive, 
however, that I grow exceedingly misanthropic and sour.&nbsp; You will say 
that this is no news, and that you never knew me possessed of the contrary 
qualities&mdash;philanthropy and sugariness.&nbsp; <i>Das ist wahr</i> 
(which being translated means, that is true); but the fact is, the people 
here are no go whatsoever.&nbsp; Amongst 120 persons which compose the 
daily population of this house, I can discern only one or two who deserve 
anything like regard.&nbsp; This is not owing to foolish fastidiousness on 
my part, but to the absence of decent qualities on theirs.&nbsp; They have 
not intellect or politeness or good-nature or good-feeling.&nbsp; They are 
nothing.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t hate them&mdash;hatred would be too warm a 
feeling.&nbsp; They have no sensations themselves and they excite 
none.&nbsp; But one wearies from day to day of caring nothing, fearing 
nothing, liking nothing, hating nothing, being nothing, doing 
nothing&mdash;yes, I teach and sometimes get red in the face with 
impatience at their stupidity.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t think I ever scold or 
fly into a passion.&nbsp; If I spoke warmly, as warmly as I sometimes used 
to do at Roe-Head, they would think me mad.&nbsp; Nobody ever gets into a 
passion here.&nbsp; Such a thing is not known.&nbsp; The phlegm that 
thickens their blood is too gluey to boil.&nbsp; They are very false in 
their relations with each other, but they rarely quarrel, and friendship is
a folly they are unacquainted with.&nbsp; The black Swan, M. H&eacute;ger, 
is the only sole veritable exception to this rule (for Madame, always cool 
and always reasoning, is not quite an exception).&nbsp; But I rarely speak 
to Monsieur now, for not being a pupil I have little or nothing to do with 
him.&nbsp; From time to time he shows his kind-heartedness by loading me 
with books, so that I am still indebted to him for all the pleasure or 
amusement I have.&nbsp; Except for the total want of companionship I have 
nothing to complain of.&nbsp; I have not too much to do, sufficient 
liberty, and I am rarely interfered with.&nbsp; I lead an easeful, 
stagnant, silent life, for which, when I think of Mrs. Sidgwick, I ought to
be very thankful.&nbsp; Be sure you write to me soon, and beg of Anne <!-- 
page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>to 
inclose a small billet in the same letter; it will be a real charity to do 
me this kindness.&nbsp; Tell me everything you can think of.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a curious metaphysical fact that always in the evening when
I am in the great dormitory alone, having no other company than a number of
beds with white curtains, I always recur as fanatically as ever to the old 
ideas, the old faces, and the old scenes in the world below.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give my love to Anne.&mdash;And believe me, yourn</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Anne</span>,&mdash;Write to 
me.&mdash;Your affectionate Schwester,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;C. B.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. H&eacute;ger has just been in and given me a little German 
Testament as a present.&nbsp; I was surprised, for since a good many days 
he has hardly spoken to me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A little later she writes to Emily in similar strain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS EMILY J. BRONT&Euml;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Brussels</span>, 
<i>May</i> 29<i>th</i>, 1843.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear E. J.</span>,&mdash;The reason of the 
unconscionable demand for money is explained in my letter to papa.&nbsp; 
Would you believe it, Mdlle. M&uuml;hl demands as much for one pupil as for
two, namely, 10 francs per month.&nbsp; This, with the 5 francs per month 
to the Blanchisseuse, makes havoc in &pound;16 per annum.&nbsp; You will 
perceive I have begun again to take German lessons.&nbsp; Things wag on 
much as usual here.&nbsp; Only Mdlle. Blanche and Mdlle. Hauss&eacute; are 
at present on a system of war without quarter.&nbsp; They hate each other 
like two cats.&nbsp; Mdlle. Blanche frightens Mdlle. Hauss&eacute; by her 
white passions (for they quarrel venomously).&nbsp; Mdlle. Hauss&eacute; 
complains that when Mdlle. Blanche is in fury, &ldquo;<i>elle n&rsquo;a pas
de levres</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I find also that Mdlle. Sophie dislikes Mdlle. 
Blanche extremely.&nbsp; She says she is heartless, insincere, and 
vindictive, which epithets, I assure you, are richly deserved.&nbsp; Also I
find she is the regular spy of Mme. H&eacute;ger, to whom she reports 
everything.&nbsp; Also she invents&mdash;which I should not have 
thought.&nbsp; I have now the <!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>entire charge of the English lessons.&nbsp; I 
have given two lessons to the first class.&nbsp; Hortense Jannoy was a 
picture on these occasions, her face was black as a &ldquo;blue-piled 
thunder-loft,&rdquo; and her two ears were red as raw beef.&nbsp; To all 
questions asked her reply was, &ldquo;<i>je ne sais pas</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
It is a pity but her friends could meet with a person qualified to cast out
a devil.&nbsp; I am richly off for companionship in these parts.&nbsp; Of 
late days, M. and Mde. H&eacute;ger rarely speak to me, and I really 
don&rsquo;t pretend to care a fig for any body else in the 
establishment.&nbsp; You are not to suppose by that expression that I am 
under the influence of <i>warm</i> affection for Mde. H&eacute;ger.&nbsp; I
am convinced she does not like me&mdash;why, I can&rsquo;t tell, nor do I 
think she herself has any definite reason for the aversion; but for one 
thing, she cannot comprehend why I do not make intimate friends of Mesdames
Blanche, Sophie, and Hauss&eacute;.&nbsp; M. H&eacute;ger is wonderously 
influenced by Madame, and I should not wonder if he disapproves very much 
of my unamiable want of sociability.&nbsp; He has already given me a brief 
lecture on universal <i>bienveillance</i>, and, perceiving that I 
don&rsquo;t improve in consequence, I fancy he has taken to considering me 
as a person to be let alone&mdash;left to the error of her ways; and 
consequently he has in a great measure withdrawn the light of his 
countenance, and I get on from day to day in a Robinson-Crusoe-like 
condition&mdash;very lonely.&nbsp; That does not signify.&nbsp; In other 
respects I have nothing substantial to complain of, nor is even this a 
cause for complaint.&nbsp; Except the loss of M. H&eacute;ger&rsquo;s 
goodwill (if I have lost it) I care for none of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; I hope you
are well and hearty.&nbsp; Walk out often on the moors.&nbsp; Sorry am I to
hear that Hannah is gone, and that she has left you burdened with the 
charge of the little girl, her sister.&nbsp; I hope Tabby will continue to 
stay with you&mdash;give my love to her.&nbsp; Regards to the fighting 
gentry, and to old asthma.&mdash;Your</p>

<p>In August she is still more dissatisfied, but &lsquo;I will <!-- page

my last letter; but, however, forgiveness is a part of the Christian Creed,
and so having an opportunity to send a letter to England, I forgive you and

in Brussels, I was surprised to hear a voice proceed from the pulpit which 
instantly brought all Birstall and Batley before my mind&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp;
I could see nothing, but certainly thought that that unclerical little 
Welsh pony, Jenkins, was there.&nbsp; I buoyed up my mind with the 
expectation of receiving a letter from you, but as, however, I have got 
none, I suppose I must have been mistaken.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;C. B.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Jenkins has called.&nbsp; He brought no letter from you, but 
said you were at Harrogate, and that they could not find the letter you had
intended to send.&nbsp; He informed me of the death of your sister.&nbsp; 
Poor Sarah, when I last bid her good-bye I little thought I should never 
see her more.&nbsp; Certainly, however, she is happy where she is 
gone&mdash;far happier than she was here.&nbsp; When the first days of 
mourning are past, you will see that you have reason rather to rejoice at 
her removal than to grieve for it.&nbsp; Your mother will have felt her 
death much&mdash;and you also.&nbsp; I fear from the circumstance of your 
being at Harrogate that you are yourself ill.&nbsp; Write to me 
soon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was in September that the incident occurred which has found so 
dramatic a setting in <i>Villette</i>&mdash;the confession to a priest of 
the Roman Catholic Church of a daughter of the most militant type of 
Protestantism; and not the least valuable of my newly-discovered 
Bront&euml; treasures is the letter which Charlotte wrote to Emily giving 
an unembellished account of the incident.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>TO MISS EMILY J. BRONT&Euml;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Brussels</span>, 
<i>September</i> 2<i>nd</i>, 1843.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear E. J.</span>,&mdash;Another opportunity 
of writing to you coming to pass, I shall improve it by scribbling a few 
lines.&nbsp; More than half the holidays are now past, and rather better 
than I expected.&nbsp; The weather has been exceedingly fine during the 
last fortnight, and yet not so Asiatically hot as it was last year at this 
time.&nbsp; Consequently I have tramped about a great deal and tried to get
a clearer acquaintance with the streets of Bruxelles.&nbsp; This week, as 
no teacher is here except Mdlle. Blanche, who is returned from Paris, I am 
always alone except at meal-times, for Mdlle. Blanche&rsquo;s character is 
so false and so contemptible I can&rsquo;t force myself to associate with 
her.&nbsp; She perceives my utter dislike and never now speaks to 
me&mdash;a great relief.</p>
<p>&lsquo;However, I should inevitably fall into the gulf of low spirits if
I stayed always by myself here without a human being to speak to, so I go 
out and traverse the Boulevards and streets of Bruxelles sometimes for 
hours together.&nbsp; Yesterday I went on a pilgrimage to the cemetery, and
far beyond it on to a hill where there was nothing but fields as far as the
horizon.&nbsp; When I came back it was evening; but I had such a repugnance
to return to the house, which contained nothing that I cared for, I still 
kept threading the streets in the neighbourhood of the Rue d&rsquo;Isabelle
and avoiding it.&nbsp; I found myself opposite to Ste. Gudule, and the 
bell, whose voice you know, began to toll for evening salut.&nbsp; I went 
in, quite alone (which procedure you will say is not much like me), 
wandered about the aisles where a few old women were saying their prayers, 
till vespers begun.&nbsp; I stayed till they were over.&nbsp; Still I could
not leave the church or force myself to go home&mdash;to school I 
mean.&nbsp; An odd whim came into my head.&nbsp; In a solitary part of the 
Cathedral six or seven people still remained kneeling by the 
confessionals.&nbsp; In two confessionals I saw a priest.&nbsp; I felt as 
if I did not care what I did, provided it was not absolutely wrong, and 
that it served to vary my life and yield a moment&rsquo;s interest.&nbsp; I
took a fancy to change myself <!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>into a Catholic and go and make a real 
confession to see what it was like.&nbsp; Knowing me as you do, you will 
think this odd, but when people are by themselves they have singular 
fancies.&nbsp; A penitent was occupied in confessing.&nbsp; They do not go 
into the sort of pew or cloister which the priest occupies, but kneel down 
on the steps and confess through a grating.&nbsp; Both the confessor and 
the penitent whisper very low, you can hardly hear their voices.&nbsp; 
After I had watched two or three penitents go and return I approached at 
last and knelt down in a niche which was just vacated.&nbsp; I had to kneel
there ten minutes waiting, for on the other side was another penitent 
invisible to me.&nbsp; At last that went away and a little wooden door 
inside the grating opened, and I saw the priest leaning his ear towards 
me.&nbsp; I was obliged to begin, and yet I did not know a word of the 
formula with which they always commence their confessions.&nbsp; It was a 
funny position.&nbsp; I felt precisely as I did when alone on the Thames at
midnight.&nbsp; I commenced with saying I was a foreigner and had been 
brought up a Protestant.&nbsp; The priest asked if I was a Protestant 
then.&nbsp; I somehow could not tell a lie and said 
&ldquo;yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; He replied that in that case I could not 
&ldquo;<i>jouir du bonheur de la confesse</i>&rdquo;; but I was determined 
to confess, and at last he said he would allow me because it might be the 
first step towards returning to the true church.&nbsp; I actually did 
confess&mdash;a real confession.&nbsp; When I had done he told me his 
address, and said that every morning I was to go to the rue du 
Parc&mdash;to his house&mdash;and he would reason with me and try to 
convince me of the error and enormity of being a Protestant!!!&nbsp; I 
promised faithfully to go.&nbsp; Of course, however, the adventure stops 
there, and I hope I shall never see the priest again.&nbsp; I think you had
better not tell papa of this.&nbsp; He will not understand that it was only
a freak, and will perhaps think I am going to turn Catholic.&nbsp; Trusting
that you and papa are well, and also Tabby and the Holyes, and hoping you 
will write to me immediately,&mdash;I am, yours,</p>

120</span>CHAPTER V: PATRICK BRANWELL BRONT&Euml;</h2>
<p>The younger Patrick Bront&euml; was always known by his mother&rsquo;s 
family name of Branwell.&nbsp; The name derived from the patron Saint of 
Ireland, with which the enthusiastic Celt, Romanist and Protestant alike, 
delights to disfigure his male child, was speedily banished from the 
Yorkshire Parsonage.&nbsp; Branwell was a year younger than Charlotte, and 
it is clear that she and her brother were &lsquo;chums,&rsquo; in the same 
way as Emily and Anne were &lsquo;chums,&rsquo; in the earlier years, 
before Charlotte made other friends.&nbsp; Even until two or three years 
from Branwell&rsquo;s death, we find Charlotte writing to him with genuine 
sisterly affection, and, indeed, the only two family letters addressed to 
Branwell which are extant are from her.&nbsp; One of them, written from 
Brussels, I have printed elsewhere.&nbsp; The other, written from Roe Head,
when Charlotte, aged sixteen, was at school there, was partly published by 
Mrs. Gaskell, but may as well be given here, copied direct from the 
original.</p>

arrived at home after your long and (I should think) very fatiguing 
journey.&nbsp; I could perceive when you arrived at Roe Head that you were 
very much tired, though you refused to acknowledge it.&nbsp; After you were
gone, many questions and subjects of conversation recurred to me which I 
had intended to mention to you, but quite forgot them in the agitation 
which I felt at the totally unexpected pleasure of seeing you.&nbsp; Lately
I had begun to think that I had lost all the interest which I used formerly
to take in politics, but the extreme pleasure I felt at the news of the 
Reform Bill&rsquo;s being thrown out by the House of Lords, and of the 
expulsion or resignation of Earl Grey, etc., etc., convinced me that I have
not as yet lost <i>all</i> my penchant for politics.&nbsp; I am extremely 
glad that aunt has consented to take in <i>Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, for
though I know from your description of its general contents it will be 
rather uninteresting when compared with <i>Blackwood</i>, still it will be 
better than remaining the whole year without being able to obtain a sight 
of any periodical publication whatever; and such would assuredly be our 
case, as in the little wild, moorland village where we reside, there would 
be no possibility of borrowing or obtaining a work of that description from
a circulating library.&nbsp; I hope with you that the present delightful 
weather may contribute to the perfect restoration of our dear papa&rsquo;s 
health, and that it may give aunt pleasant reminiscences of the salubrious 
climate of her native place.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With love to all,&mdash;Believe me, dear Branwell, to remain your
affectionate sister,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Charlotte</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to you I find the most to say&rsquo; is significant.&nbsp; And
to Branwell, Charlotte refers again and again in most affectionate terms in
many a later letter.&nbsp; It is to her enthusiasm, indeed that we largely 
owe the extravagant estimate of Branwell&rsquo;s ability which has found so
abundant expression in books on the Bront&euml;s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Branwell has himself been made the hero of at least three biographies. 
<a name="citation121"></a><a href="#footnote121" 
class="citation">[121]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Francis Grundy has no importance for 
<!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
122</span>our day other than that he prints certain letters from Branwell 
in his autobiography.&nbsp; Miss Mary F. Robinson, whatever distinction may
pertain to her verse, should never have attempted a biography of Emily 
Bront&euml;.&nbsp; Her book is mainly of significance because, appearing in
a series of <i>Eminent Women</i>, it served to emphasise the growing 
opinion that Emily, as well as Charlotte, had a place among the great 
writers of her day.&nbsp; Miss Robinson added nothing to our knowledge of 
Emily Bront&euml;, and her book devoted inordinate space to the 
shortcomings of Branwell, concerning which she had no new information.</p>
<p>Mr. Leyland&rsquo;s book is professedly a biography of Branwell, and is,
indeed, a valuable storehouse of facts.&nbsp; It might have had more 
success had it been written with greater brightness and verve.&nbsp; As it 
stands, it is a dull book, readable only by the Bront&euml; 
enthusiast.&nbsp; Mr. Leyland has no literary perception, and in his 
eagerness to show that Branwell was a genius, prints numerous letters and 
poems which sufficiently demonstrate that he was not.</p>
<p>Charlotte never hesitated in the earlier years to praise her brother as 
the genius of the family.&nbsp; We all know how eagerly the girls in any 
home circle are ready to acknowledge and accept as signs of original power 
the most impudent witticisms of a fairly clever brother.&nbsp; The 
Bront&euml; household was not exceptionally constituted in this 
respect.&nbsp; It is evident that the boy grew up with talent of a 
kind.&nbsp; He could certainly draw with more idea of perspective than his 
sisters, and one or two portraits by him are not wanting in merit.&nbsp; 
But there is no evidence of any special writing faculty, and the words 
&lsquo;genius&rsquo; and &lsquo;brilliant&rsquo; which have been freely 
applied to him are entirely misplaced.&nbsp; Branwell was thirty-one years 
of age when he died, and it was only during the last year or two of his 
life that opium and alcohol had made him intellectually hopeless.&nbsp; 
Yet, unless we accept the preposterous statement that he wrote <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>, <!-- page 123--><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>he would seem to have composed nothing which gives him the 
slightest claim to the most inconsiderable niche in the temple of 
literature.</p>
<p>Branwell appears to have worked side by side with his sisters in the 
early years, and innumerable volumes of the &lsquo;little writing&rsquo; 
bearing his signature have come into my hands.&nbsp; Verdopolis, the 
imaginary city of his sisters&rsquo; early stories, plays a considerable 
part in Branwell&rsquo;s.&nbsp; <i>Real Life in Verdopolis</i> bears date 
1833.&nbsp; <i>The Battle of Washington</i> is evidently a still more 
childish effusion.&nbsp; <i>Caractacus</i> is dated 1830, and the poems and
tiny romances continue steadily on through the years until they finally 
stop short in 1837&mdash;when Branwell is twenty years old&mdash;with a 
story entitled <i>Percy</i>.&nbsp; By the light of subsequent events it is 
interesting to note that a manuscript of 1830 bears the title of <i>The 
Liar Detected</i>.</p>
<p>It would be unfair to take these crude productions of Branwell 
Bront&euml;&rsquo;s boyhood as implying that he had no possibilities in him
of anything better, but judging from the fact that his letters, as a man of
eight and twenty, are as undistinguished as his sister&rsquo;s are 
noteworthy at a like age, we might well dismiss Branwell Bront&euml; once 
and for all, were not some epitome of his life indispensable in an account 
of the Bront&euml; circle.</p>
<p>Branwell was born at Thornton in 1817.&nbsp; When the family removed to 
Haworth he studied at the Grammar School, although, doubtless, he owed most
of his earlier tuition to his father.&nbsp; When school days were over it 
was decided that he should be an artist.&nbsp; To a certain William 
Robinson, of Leeds, he was indebted for his first lessons.&nbsp; Mrs. 
Gaskell describes a life-size drawing of Charlotte, Emily, and Anne which 
Branwell painted about this period.&nbsp; The huge canvas stood for many 
years at the top of the staircase at the parsonage. <a 
name="citation123"></a><a href="#footnote123" 
class="citation">[123]</a>&nbsp; In 1835 Branwell went up to <!-- page 
124--><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>London with 
a view to becoming a pupil at the Royal Academy Art Schools.&nbsp; The 
reason for his almost immediate reappearance at Haworth has never been 
explained.&nbsp; Probably he wasted his money and his father refused 
supplies.&nbsp; He had certainly been sufficiently in earnest at the start,
judging from this letter, of which I find a draft among his papers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO THE SECRETARY, ROYAL ACADEMY OF ARTS</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Having an earnest desire to
enter as probationary student in the Royal Academy, but not being possessed
of information as to the means of obtaining my desire, I presume to request
from you, as Secretary to the Institution, an answer to the 
questions&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;  &lsquo;Where am I to present my drawings?</p>
<p>&nbsp;  &lsquo;At what time?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and especially,</p>
<p>&nbsp;  &lsquo;Can I do it in August or September?</p>
<p>&mdash;Your obedient servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Branwell 
Bront&euml;</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1836 we find him as &lsquo;brother&rsquo; of the &lsquo;Lodge of the 
Three Graces&rsquo; at Haworth.&nbsp; In the following year he is 
practising as an artist in Bradford, and painting a number of portraits of 
the townsfolk.&nbsp; At this same period he wrote to Wordsworth, sending 
verses, which he was at the time producing with due regularity.&nbsp; In 
January 1840 Branwell became tutor in the family of Mr. Postlethwaite at 
Broughton-in-Furness.&nbsp; It was from that place that he wrote the 
incoherent and silly letter which has been more than once printed, and 
which merely serves to show that then, as always, he had an ill-regulated 
mind.&nbsp; It was from <!-- page 125--><a name="page125"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>Broughton-in-Furness also that he addresses 
Hartley Coleridge, and the letters are worth printing if only on account of
the similar destiny of the two men.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO HARTLEY COLERIDGE</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span 
class="smcap">Broughton-in-Furness</span>,<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Lancashire</span>, <i>April</i> 20<i>th</i>, 
1840.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;It is with much reluctance 
that I venture to request, for the perusal of the following lines, a 
portion of the time of one upon whom I can have no claim, and should not 
dare to intrude, but I do not, personally, know a man on whom to rely for 
an answer to the questions I shall put, and I could not resist my longing 
to ask a man from whose judgment there would be little hope of appeal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since my childhood I have been wont to devote the hours I could 
spare from other and very different employments to efforts at literary 
composition, always keeping the results to myself, nor have they in more 
than two or three instances been seen by any other.&nbsp; But I am about to
enter active life, and prudence tells me not to waste the time which must 
make my independence; yet, sir, I like writing too well to fling aside the 
practice of it without an effort to ascertain whether I could turn it to 
account, not in <i>wholly</i> maintaining myself, but in aiding my 
maintenance, for I do not sigh after fame, and am not ignorant of the folly
or the fate of those who, without ability, would depend for their lives 
upon their pens; but I seek to know, and venture, though with shame, to ask
from one whose word I must respect: whether, by periodical or other 
writing, I could please myself with writing, and make it subservient to 
living.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would not, with this view, have troubled you with a composition
in verse, but any piece I have in prose would too greatly trespass upon 
your patience, which, I fear, if you look over the verse, will be more than
sufficiently tried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I feel the egotism of my language, but I have none, sir, in my 
heart, for I feel beyond all encouragement from myself, and I hope for none
from you.</p>
<p><!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
126</span>&lsquo;Should you give any opinion upon what I send, it will, 
however condemnatory, be most gratefully received by,&mdash;Sir, your most 
humble servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">P. B. 
Bront&euml;</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;The first piece is only the sequel of one 
striving to depict the fall from unguided passion into neglect, despair, 
and death.&nbsp; It ought to show an hour too near those of pleasure for 
repentance, and too near death for hope.&nbsp; The translations are two out
of many made from Horace, and given to assist an answer to the 
question&mdash;would it be possible to obtain remuneration for translations
for such as those from that or any other classic author?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Branwell would appear to have gone over to Ambleside to see Hartley 
Coleridge, if we may judge by that next letter, written from Haworth upon 
his return.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO HARTLEY COLERIDGE</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>June</i> 27<i>th</i>, 1840.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;You will, perhaps, have 
forgotten me, but it will be long before I forget my first conversation 
with a man of real intellect, in my first visit to the classic lakes of 
Westmoreland.</p>
<p>&lsquo;During the delightful day which I had the honour of spending with
you at Ambleside, I received permission to transmit to you, as soon as 
finished, the first book of a translation of Horace, in order that, after a
glance over it, you might tell me whether it was worth further notice or 
better fit for the fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have&mdash;I fear most negligently, and amid other very 
different employments&mdash;striven to translate two books, the first of 
which I have presumed to send to you.&nbsp; And will you, sir, stretch your
past kindness by telling me whether I should amend and pursue the work or 
let it rest in peace?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Great corrections I feel it wants, but till I feel that the work 
might benefit me, I have no heart to make them; yet if your judgment prove 
in any way favourable, I will re-write the whole, without sparing labour to
reach perfection.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I dared not have attempted Horace but that I saw the utter 
worthlessness of all former translations, and thought that a better <!-- 
page 127--><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>one, by
whomsoever executed, might meet with some little encouragement.&nbsp; I 
long to clear up my doubts by the judgment of one whose opinion I should 
revere, and&mdash;but I suppose I am dreaming&mdash;one to whom I should be
proud indeed to inscribe anything of mine which any publisher would look 
at, unless, as is likely enough, the work would disgrace the name as much 
as the name would honour the work.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Amount of remuneration I should not look to&mdash;as anything 
would be everything&mdash;and whatever it might be, let me say that my 
bones would have no rest unless by written agreement a division should be 
made of the profits (little or much) between myself and him through whom 
alone I could hope to obtain a hearing with that formidable personage, a 
London bookseller.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Excuse my unintelligibility, haste, and appearance of 
presumption, and&mdash;Believe me to be, sir, your most humble and grateful
servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">P. B. 
Bront&euml;</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If anything in this note should displease you, lay it, sir, to 
the account of inexperience and <i>not</i> impudence.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In October 1840, we find Branwell clerk-in-charge at the Station of 
Sowerby Bridge on the Leeds and Manchester Railway, and the following year 
at Luddenden Foot, where Mr. Grundy, the railway engineer, became 
acquainted with him, and commenced the correspondence contained in 
<i>Pictures of the Past</i>.</p>
<p>I have in my possession a small memorandum book, evidently used by 
Branwell when engaged as a railway clerk.&nbsp; There are notes in it upon 
the then existing railways, demonstrating that he was trying to prime 
himself with the requisite facts and statistics for a career of that 
kind.&nbsp; But side by side with these are verses upon &lsquo;Lord 
Nelson,&rsquo; &lsquo;Robert Burns,&rsquo; and kindred themes, with such 
estimable sentiments as this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Then England&rsquo;s love and England&rsquo;s tongue<br />
And England&rsquo;s heart shall reverence long<br />
The wisdom deep, the courage strong,<br />
Of English Johnson&rsquo;s name.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
128</span>Altogether a literary atmosphere had been kindled for the boy had
he had the slightest strength of character to go with it.&nbsp; The railway
company, however, were soon tired of his vagaries, and in the beginning of 
1842 he returns to the Haworth parsonage.&nbsp; The following letter to his
friend Mr. Grundy is of biographical interest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO FRANCIS H. GRUNDY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>October</i> 25<i>th</i>, 1842.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;There is no 
misunderstanding.&nbsp; I have had a long attendance at the death-bed of 
the Rev. Mr. Weightman, one of my dearest friends, and now I am attending 
at the deathbed of my aunt, who has been for twenty years as my 
mother.&nbsp; I expect her to die in a few hours.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As my sisters are far from home, I have had much on my mind, and 
these things must serve as an apology for what was never intended as 
neglect of your friendship to us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had meant not only to have written to you, but to the Rev. 
James Martineau, gratefully and sincerely acknowledging the receipt of his 
most kindly and truthful criticism&mdash;at least in advice, though too 
generous far in praise; but one sad ceremony must, I fear, be gone through 
first.&nbsp; Give my most sincere respects to Mr. Stephenson, and excuse 
this scrawl&mdash;my eyes are too dim with sorrow to see 
well.&mdash;Believe me, your not very happy but obliged friend and 
servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">P. B. 
Bront&euml;</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A week later he writes to the same friend:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I am incoherent, I fear, but I have been waking two nights 
witnessing such agonising suffering as I would not wish my worst enemy to 
endure; and I have now lost the guide and director of all the happy days 
connected with my childhood.&nbsp; I have suffered much sorrow since I last
saw you at Haworth.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Charlotte and Anne, it will be remembered, were at this time on their 
way home from Brussels, and Anne had to seek relief from her governess 
bonds at Mrs. Robinson&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Branwell would seem to have returned 
with Anne to Thorp <!-- page 129--><a name="page129"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>Green, as tutor to Mr. Robinson&rsquo;s 
son.&nbsp; He commenced his duties in December 1842.</p>
<p>It would not be rash to assume&mdash;although it is only an 
assumption&mdash;that Branwell took to opium soon after he entered upon his
duties at Thorp Green.&nbsp; I have already said something of the trouble 
which befel Mrs. Gaskell in accepting the statements of Charlotte 
Bront&euml;, and&mdash;after Charlotte&rsquo;s death&mdash;of her friends, 
to the effect that Branwell became the prey of a designing woman, who 
promised to marry him when her husband&mdash;a venerable 
clergyman&mdash;should be dead.&nbsp; The story has been told too 
often.&nbsp; Branwell was dismissed, and returned to the parsonage to rave 
about his wrongs.&nbsp; If Mr. Robinson should die, the widow had promised 
to marry him, he assured his friends.&nbsp; Mr. Robinson did die (May 26, 
1846), and then Branwell insisted that by his will he had prohibited his 
wife from marrying, under penalties of forfeiting the estate.&nbsp; A copy 
of the document is in my possession:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>The eleventh day of September</i> 1846 <i>the Will of the Reverend 
Edmund Robinson</i>, <i>late of Thorp Green</i>, <i>in the Parish of Little
Ouseburn</i>, <i>in the County of York</i>, <i>Clerk</i>, <i>deceased</i>, 
<i>was proved in the Prerogative Court of York by the oaths of Lydia 
Robinson</i>, <i>Widow</i>, <i>his Relict</i>; <i>the Venerable Charles 
Thorp and Henry Newton</i>, <i>the Executors</i>, <i>to whom administration
was granted</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, the will, a lengthy document, put no restraint whatever
upon the actions of Mrs. Robinson.&nbsp; Upon the publication of Mrs. 
Gaskell&rsquo;s Life she was eager to clear her character in the 
law-courts, but was dissuaded therefrom by friends, who pointed out that a 
withdrawal of the obnoxious paragraphs in succeeding editions of the 
Memoir, and the publication of a letter in the <i>Times</i>, would 
sufficiently meet the case.</p>
<p><!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

to a widowed lady, referred to, but not named therein, any breach of her 
conjugal, of her maternal, or of her social duties, and more especially of 
the statement contained in chapter 13 of the first volume, and in chapter 2

<p>A certain &lsquo;Note&rsquo; in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> a few days 
later is not without interest now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;We are sorry to be called upon to return to Mrs. Gaskell&rsquo;s

gone forth with our recommendation.&nbsp; Praise, it is needless to point 
out, implied trust in the biographer as an accurate collector of 
facts.&nbsp; This, we regret to state, Mrs. Gaskell proves not to have 
been.&nbsp; To the gossip which for weeks past has been seething and 
circulating in the London <i>coteries</i>, we gave small heed; but the

withdrawing the statements put forth in her book respecting the cause of

could only be excused by the story of sin being severely, strictly true; 
and every one will have cause to regret that due caution was not used to 
test representations not, it seems, to be justified.&nbsp; It is in the 
interest of Letters that biographers should be deterred from rushing into 
print with mere impressions in place of proofs, however eager and sincere 
those impressions may be.&nbsp; They <i>may be</i> slanders, and as such 
they may sting cruelly.&nbsp; Meanwhile the <i>Life of Charlotte

circulated.&rsquo;</p>

you live, move, and have your being.&nbsp; Mary Taylor&rsquo;s letter was 
deeply interesting and strongly characteristic.&nbsp; I have no news 
whatever to communicate.&nbsp; No changes take place here.&nbsp; Branwell 
offers no prospect of hope; he professes to be too ill to think of seeking 
for employment; he makes comfort scant at home.&nbsp; I hold to my

so far&mdash;I hope fervently you will still be enabled to do so.&nbsp; Yet
there is something in your letter that makes me fear the present is <!--

can.&nbsp; Branwell and Anne leave us on Saturday.&nbsp; Branwell has been 
quieter and less irritable on the whole this time than he was in

she <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
133</span>did not fail to tell me that you were gone into 
Worcestershire.&nbsp; She was unable, however, to give me your address; had
I known it I should have written to you long since.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought you would wonder how we were getting on when you heard 
of the Railway Panic, and you may be sure I am very glad to be able to 
answer your kind inquiries by an assurance that our small capital is as yet
undiminished.&nbsp; The &ldquo;York and Midland&rdquo; is, as you say, a 
very good line, yet I confess to you I should wish, for my part, to be wise
in time.&nbsp; I cannot think that even the very best lines will continue 
for many years at their present premiums, and I have been most anxious for 
us to sell our shares ere it be too late, and to secure the proceeds in 
some safer, if, for the present, less profitable investment.&nbsp; I 
cannot, however, persuade my sisters to regard the affair precisely from my
point of view, and I feel as if I would rather run the risk of loss than 
hurt Emily&rsquo;s feelings by acting in direct opposition to her 
opinion.&nbsp; She managed in a most handsome and able manner for me when I
was at Brussels, and prevented by distance from looking after my own 
interests; therefore, I will let her manage still, and take the 
consequences.&nbsp; Disinterested and energetic she certainly is, and if 
she be not quite so tractable or open to conviction as I could wish, I must
remember perfection is not the lot of humanity.&nbsp; And as long as we can
regard those we love, and to whom we are closely allied, with profound and 
very unshaken esteem, it is a small thing that they should vex us 
occasionally by, what appear to us, unreasonable and headstrong 
notions.&nbsp; You, my dear Miss Wooler, know full as well as I do the 
value of sisters&rsquo; affection to each other; there is nothing like it 
in this world, I believe, when they are nearly equal in age, and similar in
education, tastes, and sentiments.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ask about Branwell.&nbsp; He never thinks of seeking 
employment, and I begin to fear he has rendered himself incapable of 
filling any respectable station in life; besides, if money were at his 
disposal he would use it only to his own injury; the faculty of 
self-government is, I fear, almost destroyed in him.&nbsp; You ask me if I 
do not think men are <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>strange beings.&nbsp; I do, indeed&mdash;I 
have often thought so; and I think too that the mode of bringing them up is
strange, they are not half sufficiently guarded from temptations.&nbsp; 
Girls are protected as if they were something very frail and silly indeed, 
while boys are turned loose on the world as if they, of all beings in 
existence, were the wisest and the least liable to be led astray.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad you like Bromsgrove.&nbsp; I always feel a peculiar 
satisfaction when I hear of your enjoying yourself, because it proves to me
that there is really such a thing as retributive justice even in this life;
now you are free, and that while you have still, I hope, many years of 
vigour and health in which you can enjoy freedom.&nbsp; Besides, I have 
another and very egotistical motive for being pleased: it seems that even 
&ldquo;a lone woman&rdquo; can be happy, as well as cherished wives and 
proud mothers.&nbsp; I am glad of that&mdash;I speculate much on the 
existence of unmarried and never-to-be married woman now-a-days, and I have
already got to the point of considering that there is no more respectable 
character on this earth than an unmarried woman who makes her own way 
through life quietly, perseveringly, without support of husband or mother, 
and who, having attained the age of forty-five or upwards, retains in her 
possession a well-regulated mind, a disposition to enjoy simple pleasures, 
fortitude to support inevitable pains, sympathy with the sufferings of 
others, and willingness to relieve want as far as her means extend.&nbsp; I
wish to send this letter off by to-day&rsquo;s post, I must therefore 
conclude in haste.&mdash;Believe me, my dear Miss Wooler, yours, most 
affectionately,</p>

long without answering you.&nbsp; The fact is, I had hoped to be able to 
ask you to come to Haworth.&nbsp; Branwell seemed to have a prospect of 
getting employment, and I waited to know the result of his efforts in order
to say, &ldquo;Dear Ellen, come and see <!-- page 135--><a

something was wrong.&nbsp; It relieved me much to find my apprehensions 
unfounded.&nbsp; I return you Miss Ringrose&rsquo;s notes with 
thanks.&nbsp; I always like to read them, they appear to me so true an

beware of awakening in her this consciousness by undue praise.&nbsp; It is 
the privilege of simple-hearted, sensible, but not brilliant people, that 
they can <i>be</i> and <i>do</i> good without comparing their own thoughts 
and actions too closely with those of other people, and thence drawing 
strong food for self-appreciation.&nbsp; Talented people almost always know
full well the excellence that is in them.&nbsp; I wish I could say anything
favourable, but how can we be more comfortable so long as Branwell stays at
home, and degenerates instead of improving?&nbsp; It has been lately 
intimated to him, that he would be received again on the railroad where he 
was formerly stationed if he would behave more steadily, but he refuses to 
make an effort; he will not work; and at home he is a drain on every 
resource&mdash;an impediment to all happiness.&nbsp; But there is no use in
complaining.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I was glad to 
perceive, by the tone of your last letter, that you are beginning to be a 
little more settled.&nbsp; We, I am sorry to say, have been somewhat more 
harassed than usual lately.&nbsp; The death of Mr. Robinson, which took 
place about three weeks or a month ago, served Branwell for a pretext to 
throw all about him into hubbub and confusion with his emotions, etc., 
etc.&nbsp; Shortly after came news from all hands that Mr. Robinson had 
altered his will before he died, and effectually prevented all chance of a 
marriage between his widow and Branwell, by stipulating that she should not
have a shilling if she ever ventured to re-open any communication with 
him.&nbsp; Of course he then became intolerable.&nbsp; To papa he allows 
rest neither day nor night, and he is continually screwing money out of 
him, sometimes threatening that he will kill himself if it is withheld from
him.&nbsp; He says Mrs. Robinson is now insane; that her mind is a complete
wreck owing to remorse for her conduct towards Mr. Robinson (whose end it 
appears was hastened by distress of mind) and grief for having lost 
him.&nbsp; I do not know how much to believe of what he says, but I fear 
she is very ill.&nbsp; Branwell declares that he neither can nor will do 
anything for himself.&nbsp; Good situations have been offered him more than
once, for which, by a fortnight&rsquo;s work, he might have qualified 
himself, but he will do nothing, except drink and make us all 
wretched.&nbsp; I had a note from Ellen Taylor a week ago, in which she 
remarks that letters were received from New Zealand a month since, and that
all was well.&nbsp; I should like to hear from you again soon.&nbsp; I hope
one day to see Brookroyd again, though I think it will not be

conducting himself very badly lately.&nbsp; I expect from the extravagance 
of his behaviour, <!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span

never will speak out plainly), that we shall be hearing news of fresh debts
contracted by him soon.&nbsp; The Misses Robinson, who had entirely ceased 
their correspondence with Anne for half a year after their father&rsquo;s 
death, have lately recommenced it.&nbsp; For a fortnight they sent her a 
letter almost every day, crammed with warm protestations of endless esteem 
and gratitude.&nbsp; They speak with great affection too of their mother, 
and never make any allusion intimating acquaintance with her errors.&nbsp;

<p>Branwell Bront&euml; died on Sunday, September the 24th, 1848, <a

and the two following letters from Charlotte to her friend Mr. Williams are
peculiarly interesting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>October</i> 2<i>nd</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;&ldquo;We have 
hurried our dead out of our sight.&rdquo;&nbsp; A lull begins to succeed 
the gloomy tumult of last week.&nbsp; It is not permitted us to grieve for 
him who is gone as others grieve for those they lose.&nbsp; The removal of 
our only brother must necessarily be regarded by us rather in the light of 
a mercy than a chastisement.&nbsp; Branwell was his father&rsquo;s and his 
sisters&rsquo; pride and hope in boyhood, but since manhood the case has 
been otherwise.&nbsp; It has been our lot to see him take a wrong bent; to 
hope, expect, wait his return to the right path; to know the sickness of 
hope deferred, the dismay of prayer baffled; to experience despair at 
last&mdash;and now to behold the sudden early obscure close of what might 
have been a noble career.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not weep from a sense of bereavement&mdash;there is no prop 
withdrawn, no consolation torn away, no dear companion lost&mdash;but for 
the wreck of talent, the ruin of promise, the untimely dreary extinction of
what might have been a burning and a shining light.&nbsp; My brother was a 
year my junior.&nbsp; I had aspirations and ambitions for him once, long 
ago&mdash;they have perished mournfully.&nbsp; Nothing remains of him but a
memory <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
139</span>of errors and sufferings.&nbsp; There is such a bitterness of 
pity for his life and death, such a yearning for the emptiness of his whole
existence as I cannot describe.&nbsp; I trust time will allay these 
feelings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My poor father naturally thought more of his <i>only</i> son than
of his daughters, and, much and long as he had suffered on his account, he 
cried out for his loss like David for that of Absalom&mdash;my son my 
son!&mdash;and refused at first to be comforted.&nbsp; And then when I 
ought to have been able to collect my strength and be at hand to support 
him, I fell ill with an illness whose approaches I had felt for some time 
previously, and of which the crisis was hastened by the awe and trouble of 
the death-scene&mdash;the first I had ever witnessed.&nbsp; The past has 
seemed to me a strange week.&nbsp; Thank God, for my father&rsquo;s sake, I
am better now, though still feeble.&nbsp; I wish indeed I had more general 
physical strength&mdash;the want of it is sadly in my way.&nbsp; I cannot 
do what I would do for want of sustained animal spirits and efficient 
bodily vigour.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My unhappy brother never knew what his sisters had done in 
literature&mdash;he was not aware that they had ever published a 
line.&nbsp; We could not tell him of our efforts for fear of causing him 
too deep a pang of remorse for his own time mis-spent, and talents 
misapplied.&nbsp; Now he will <i>never</i> know.&nbsp; I cannot dwell 
longer on the subject at present&mdash;it is too painful.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thank you for your kind sympathy, and pray earnestly that your 
sons may all do well, and that you may be spared the sufferings my father 
has gone through.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. 
Bront&euml;</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>October</i> 6<i>th</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I thank you for 
your last truly friendly letter, and for the number of <i>Blackwood</i> 
which accompanied it.&nbsp; Both arrived at a time when a relapse of 
illness had depressed me much.&nbsp; Both did me good, especially the 
letter.&nbsp; I have only one fault to find with your expressions of 
friendship: they make me ashamed, because they seem to imply <!-- page 
140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>that you 
think better of me than I merit.&nbsp; I believe you are prone to think too
highly of your fellow-creatures in general&mdash;to see too exclusively the
good points of those for whom you have a regard.&nbsp; Disappointment must 
be the inevitable result of this habit.&nbsp; Believe all men, and women 
too, to be dust and ashes&mdash;a spark of the divinity now and then 
kindling in the dull heap&mdash;that is all.&nbsp; When I looked on the 
noble face and forehead of my dead brother (nature had favoured him with a 
fairer outside, as well as a finer constitution, than his sisters) and 
asked myself what had made him go ever wrong, tend ever downwards, when he 
had so many gifts to induce to, and aid in, an upward course, I seemed to 
receive an oppressive revelation of the feebleness of humanity&mdash;of the
inadequacy of even genius to lead to true greatness if unaided by religion 
and principle.&nbsp; In the value, or even the reality, of these two things
he would never believe till within a few days of his end; and then all at 
once he seemed to open his heart to a conviction of their existence and 
worth.&nbsp; The remembrance of this strange change now comforts my poor 
father greatly.&nbsp; I myself, with painful, mournful joy, heard him 
praying softly in his dying moments; and to the last prayer which my father
offered up at his bedside he added, &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo;&nbsp; How unusual 
that word appeared from his lips, of course you, who did not know him, 
cannot conceive.&nbsp; Akin to this alteration was that in his feelings 
towards his relations&mdash;all the bitterness seemed gone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When the struggle was over, and a marble calm began to succeed 
the last dread agony, I felt, as I had never felt before, that there was 
peace and forgiveness for him in Heaven.&nbsp; All his errors&mdash;to 
speak plainly, all his vices&mdash;seemed nothing to me in that moment: 
every wrong he had done, every pain he had caused, vanished; his sufferings
only were remembered; the wrench to the natural affections only was 
left.&nbsp; If man can thus experience total oblivion of his fellow&rsquo;s
imperfections, how much more can the Eternal Being, who made man, forgive 
His creature?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had his sins been scarlet in their dye, I believe now they are 
white as wool.&nbsp; He is at rest, and that comforts us all.&nbsp; <!-- 
page 141--><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>Long 
before he quitted this world, life had no happiness for him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Blackwood&rsquo;s</i> mention of <i>Jane Eyre</i> gratified me
much, and will gratify me more, I dare say, when the ferment of other 
feelings than that of literary ambition shall have a little subsided in my 
mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The doctor has told me I must not expect too rapid a restoration 
to health; but to-day I certainly feel better.&nbsp; I am thankful to say 
my father has hitherto stood the storm well; and so have my <i>dear</i> 
sisters, to whose untiring care and kindness I am chiefly indebted for my 
present state of convalescence.&mdash;Believe me, my dear sir, yours 
faithfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. 
Bront&euml;</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last letter in order of date that I have concerning Branwell is 
addressed to Ellen Nussey&rsquo;s sister:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS MERCY NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>October</i> 25<i>th</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Nussey</span>,&mdash;Accept my 
sincere thanks for your kind letter.&nbsp; The event to which you allude 
came upon us with startling suddenness, and was a severe shock to us 
all.&nbsp; My poor brother has long had a shaken constitution, and during 
the summer his appetite had been diminished, and he had seemed weaker, but 
neither we, nor himself, nor any medical man who was consulted on the case,
thought it one of immediate danger.&nbsp; He was out of doors two days 
before death, and was only confined to bed one single day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thank you for your kind sympathy.&nbsp; Many, under the 
circumstances, would think our loss rather a relief than otherwise; in 
truth, we must acknowledge, in all humility and gratitude, that God has 
greatly tempered judgment with mercy.&nbsp; But yet, as you doubtless know 
from experience, the last earthly separation cannot take place between near
relatives without the keenest pangs on the part of the survivors.&nbsp; 
Every wrong and sin is forgotten then, pity and grief share the heart and 
the memory between them.&nbsp; Yet we are not without comfort in our <!-- 
page 142--><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
142</span>affliction.&nbsp; A most propitious change marked the few last 
days of poor Branwell&rsquo;s life: his demeanour, his language, his 
sentiments were all singularly altered and softened.&nbsp; This change 
could not be owing to the fear of death, for till within half-an-hour of 
his decease he seemed unconscious of danger.&nbsp; In God&rsquo;s hands we 
leave him: He sees not as man sees.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa, I am thankful to say, has borne the event pretty 
well.&nbsp; His distress was great at first&mdash;to lose an only son is no
ordinary trial, but his physical strength has not hitherto failed him, and 
he has now in a great measure recovered his mental composure; my dear 
sisters are pretty well also.&nbsp; Unfortunately, illness attacked me at 
the crisis when strength was most needed.&nbsp; I bore up for a day or two,
hoping to be better, but got worse.&nbsp; Fever, sickness, total loss of 
appetite, and internal pain were the symptoms.&nbsp; The doctor pronounced 
it to be bilious fever, but I think it must have been in a mitigated form; 
it yielded to medicine and care in a few days.&nbsp; I was only confined to
my bed a week, and am, I trust, nearly well now.&nbsp; I felt it a grievous
thing to be incapacitated from action and effort at a time when action and 
effort were most called for.&nbsp; The past month seems an overclouded 
period in my life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give my best love to Mrs. Nussey and your sister, 
and&mdash;Believe me, my dear Miss Nussey, yours sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C.

<p><i>My unhappy brother never knew what his sisters had done in

</blockquote>
<p>Who that reads these words addressed to Mr. Williams can for a moment 
imagine that Charlotte is speaking other than the truth?&nbsp; And yet we 
have Mr. Grundy writing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Patrick Bront&euml; declared to me that he wrote a great portion 
of</i> &lsquo;<i>Wuthering Heights</i>&rsquo; <i>himself</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Mr. George Searle Phillips, <a name="citation142"></a><a 
href="#footnote142" class="citation">[142]</a> with more vivid imagination,
describes Branwell holding forth to his friends in the <!-- page 143--><a 
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>parlour of the Black 
Bull at Haworth, upon the genius of his sisters, and upon the respective 
merits of <i>Jane Eyre</i> and other works.&nbsp; Mr. Leyland is even so 
foolish as to compare Branwell&rsquo;s poetry with Emily&rsquo;s, to the 
advantage of the former&mdash;which makes further comment impossible.&nbsp;
&lsquo;My unhappy brother never knew what his sisters had done in 
literature&rsquo;&mdash;these words of Charlotte&rsquo;s may be taken as 
final for all who had any doubts concerning the authorship of <i>Wuthering 
Heights</i>.</p>
<h2><!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
144</span>CHAPTER VI: EMILY JANE BRONT&Euml;</h2>
<p>Emily Bront&euml; is the sphinx of our modern literature.&nbsp; She came
into being in the family of an obscure clergyman, and she went out of it at
twenty-nine years of age without leaving behind her one single significant 
record which was any key to her character or to her mode of thought, save 
only the one famous novel, <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, and a few 
poems&mdash;some three or four of which will live in our poetic anthologies
for ever.&nbsp; And she made no single friend other than her sister 
Anne.&nbsp; With Anne she must have corresponded during the two or three 
periods of her life when she was separated from that much loved sister; and
we may be sure that the correspondence was of a singularly affectionate 
character.&nbsp; Charlotte, who never came very near to her in thought or 
sympathy, although she loved her younger sister so deeply, addressed her in
one letter &lsquo;mine own bonnie love&rsquo;; and it is certain that her 
own letters to her two sisters, and particularly to Anne, must have been 
peculiarly tender and in no way lacking in abundant self-revelation.&nbsp; 
When Emily and Anne had both gone to the grave, Charlotte, it is probable, 
carefully destroyed every scrap of their correspondence, and, indeed, of 
their literary effects; and thus it is that, apart from her books and 
literary fragments, we know Emily only by two formal letters to her 
sister&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; Beyond these there is not one scrap of 
information as to Emily&rsquo;s outlook upon life.&nbsp; In infancy she 
went with Charlotte to <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>Cowan Bridge, and was described by the 
governess as &lsquo;a pretty little thing.&rsquo;&nbsp; In girlhood she 
went to Miss Wooler&rsquo;s school at Roe Head; but there, unlike 
Charlotte, she made no friends.&nbsp; She and Anne were inseparable when at
home, but of what they said to one another there is no record.&nbsp; The 
sisters must have differed in many ways.&nbsp; Anne, gentle and persuasive,
grew up like Charlotte, devoted to the Christianity of her father and 
mother, and entirely in harmony with all the conditions of a 
parsonage.&nbsp; It is impossible to think that the author of &lsquo;The 
Old Stoic&rsquo; and &lsquo;Last Lines&rsquo; was equally attached to the 
creeds of the churches; but what Emily thought on religious subjects the 
world will never know.&nbsp; Mrs. Gaskell put to Miss Nussey this very 
question: &lsquo;What was Emily&rsquo;s religion?&rsquo;&nbsp; But Emily 
was the last person in the world to have spoken to the most friendly of 
visitors about so sacred a theme.&nbsp; For a short time, as we know, Emily
was in a school at Law Hill near Halifax&mdash;a Miss Patchet&rsquo;s. <a 
name="citation145a"></a><a href="#footnote145a" 
class="citation">[145a]</a>&nbsp; She was, for a still longer period, at 
the H&eacute;ger Pensionnat at Brussels.&nbsp; Mrs. Gaskell&rsquo;s 
business was to write the life of Charlotte Bront&euml; and not of her 
sister Emily; and as a result there is little enough of Emily in Mrs. 
Gaskell&rsquo;s book&mdash;no record of the Halifax and Brussels life as 
seen through Emily&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; Time, however, has brought its 
revenge.&nbsp; The cult which started with Mr. Sydney Dobell, and found 
poetic expression in Mr. Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s fine lines on her,</p>

her in the very forefront of English women of genius.</p>
<p>We have said that Emily Bront&euml; is a sphinx whose riddle no amount 
of research will enable us to read; and this chapter, it may be admitted, 
adds but little to the longed-for knowledge of an interesting 
personality.&nbsp; One scrap of Emily&rsquo;s handwriting, of a personal 
character, has indeed come to me&mdash;overlooked, I doubt not, by 
Charlotte when she burnt her sister&rsquo;s effects.&nbsp; I have before me
a little tin box about two inches long, which one day last year Mr. 
Nicholls turned out from the bottom of a desk.&nbsp; It is of a kind in 
which one might keep pins or beads, certainly of no value whatever apart 
from its associations.&nbsp; Within were four little pieces of paper neatly
folded to the size of a sixpence.&nbsp; These papers were covered with 
handwriting, two of them by Emily, and two by Anne Bront&euml;.&nbsp; They 
revealed a pleasant if eccentric arrangement on the part of the sisters, 
which appears to have been settled upon even after they had passed their 
twentieth year.&nbsp; They had agreed to write a kind of reminiscence every
four years, to be opened by Emily on her birthday.&nbsp; The papers, 
however, tell their own story, and I give first the two which were written 
in 1841.&nbsp; Emily writes at Haworth, and Anne from her situation as 
governess to Mr. Robinson&rsquo;s children at Thorp Green.&nbsp; At this 
time, at any rate, Emily was fairly happy and in excellent health; and 
although it is five years from the publication of the volume of poems, she 
is full of literary projects, as is also her sister Anne.&nbsp; The 
<i>Gondaland Chronicles</i>, to which reference is made, must remain a 
mystery for us.&nbsp; They were doubtless destroyed, with abundant other 
memorials of Emily, by the heart-broken sister who survived her.&nbsp; We 
have plentiful material in the way of childish effort by Charlotte and by 
Branwell, but there is hardly a scrap in the early handwriting of Emily and
Anne.&nbsp; This chapter would have been more interesting if only one 
possessed <i>Solala Vernon&rsquo;s Life</i> by Anne Bront&euml;, or the 
<i>Gondaland Chronicles</i> by Emily!</p>

<p><i>Emily Jane Bront&euml;</i>.&nbsp; <i>July the</i> 30<i>th</i>, 
1841.</p>
<p><i>It is Friday evening</i>, <i>near 9 o&rsquo;clock</i>&mdash;<i>wild 
rainy weather</i>.&nbsp; <i>I am seated in the dining-room</i>, <i>having 
just concluded tidying our desk boxes</i>, <i>writing this 
document</i>.&nbsp; <i>Papa is in the parlour</i>&mdash;<i>aunt upstairs in
her room</i>.&nbsp; <i>She has been reading Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine to 
papa</i>.&nbsp; <i>Victoria and Adelaide are ensconced in the 
peat-house</i>.&nbsp; <i>Keeper is in the kitchen</i>&mdash;<i>Hero in his 
cage</i>.&nbsp; <i>We are all stout and hearty</i>, <i>as I hope is the 
case with Charlotte</i>, <i>Branwell</i>, <i>and Anne</i>, <i>of whom the 
first is at John White</i>, <i>Esq.</i>, <i>Upperwood House</i>, 
<i>Rawdon</i>; <i>the second is at Luddenden Foot</i>; <i>and the third 
is</i>, <i>I believe</i>, <i>at Scarborough</i>, <i>enditing perhaps a 
paper corresponding to this</i>.</p>
<p><i>A scheme is at present in agitation for setting us up in a school of 
our own</i>; <i>as yet nothing is determined</i>, <i>but I hope and trust 
it may go on and prosper and answer our highest expectations</i>.&nbsp; 
<i>This day four years I wonder whether we shall still be dragging on in 
our present condition or established to our hearts&rsquo; 
content</i>.&nbsp; <i>Time will show</i>.</p>
<p><i>I guess that at the time appointed for the opening of this paper 
we</i>, i.e. <i>Charlotte</i>, <i>Anne</i>, <i>and I</i>, <i>shall be all 
merrily seated in our own sitting-room in some pleasant and flourishing 
seminary</i>, <i>having just gathered in for the midsummer 
ladyday</i>.&nbsp; <i>Our debts will be paid off</i>, <i>and we shall have

different from this bleak look-out</i>, <i>and Anne and I will perchance 
slip out into the garden for a few minutes to peruse our papers</i>.&nbsp; 
<i>I hope either this or something better will be the case</i>.</p>

<p>Anne, as I have said, writes from Thorp Green.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>July the</i> 30<i>th</i>, A.D. 1841.</p>

another</i>.&nbsp; <i>I am now at Scarborough</i>.&nbsp; <i>My pupils are 
gone to bed and I am hastening to finish this before I follow them</i>.</p>
<p><i>We are thinking of setting up a school of our own</i>, <i>but nothing
definite is settled about it yet</i>, <i>and we do not know whether we 
shall be able to or not</i>.&nbsp; <i>I hope we shall</i>.&nbsp; <i>And I

tutor in Cumberland</i>, <i>left it</i>, <i>and become a clerk on the 
railroad</i>.&nbsp; <i>Tabby has left us</i>, <i>Martha Brown has come in 
her place</i>.&nbsp; <i>We have got Keeper</i>, <i>got a sweet little cat 
and lost it</i>, <i>and also got a hawk</i>.&nbsp; <i>Got a wild goose 
which has flown away</i>, <i>and three tame ones</i>, <i>one of which has 
been killed</i>.&nbsp; <i>All these diversities</i>, <i>with many 
others</i>, <i>are things we did not expect or foresee in the July of</i> 
1837.&nbsp; <i>What will the next four years bring forth</i>?&nbsp;

little alteration since that time</i>.&nbsp; <i>I have the same faults that
I had then</i>, <i>only I have more wisdom and experience</i>, <i>and a 
little more self-possession than I then enjoyed</i>.&nbsp; <i>How will it 
be when we open this paper and the one Emily has written</i>?&nbsp; <i>I 
wonder whether the Gondaliand will still be flourishing</i>, <i>and what

<p>Let us next take up the other two little scraps of paper.&nbsp; They are
dated July the 30th, 1845, or Emily&rsquo;s twenty-seventh birthday.&nbsp; 
Many things have happened, as she says.&nbsp; <!-- page 150--><a 
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>She has been to 
Brussels, and she has settled definitely at home again.&nbsp; They are 
still keenly interested in literature, and we still hear of the 
Gondals.&nbsp; There is wonderfully little difference in the tone or spirit
of the journals.&nbsp; The concluding &lsquo;best wishes for this whole 
house till July the 30th, 1848, and as much longer as may be,&rsquo; 
contain no premonition of coming disaster.&nbsp; Yet July 1848 was to find 
Branwell Bront&euml; on the verge of the grave, and Emily on her 
deathbed.&nbsp; She died on the 14th of December of that year.</p>

my twenty-third birthday</i>.&nbsp; <i>This paper we intend</i>, <i>if all 
be well</i>, <i>to open on my thirtieth</i>&mdash;<i>three years hence</i>,
<i>in</i> 1848.&nbsp; <i>Since the</i> 1841 <i>paper the following events 
have taken place</i>.&nbsp; <i>Our school scheme has been abandoned</i>,

<p><i>Branwell left his place at Luddenden Foot</i>.&nbsp; <i>C. and I 
returned from Brussels</i>, <i>November</i> 8<i>th</i> 1842, <i>in

<p><i>Charlotte returned to Brussels the same month</i>, <i>and</i>,

<p>Finally, I give Anne&rsquo;s last fragment, concerning which silence is 
essential.&nbsp; Interpretation of most of the references would be mere 
guess-work.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Exactly fifty years were to elapse before these pieces of writing saw 
the light.&nbsp; The interest which must always centre in Emily Bront&euml;
amply justifies my publishing a fragment in facsimile; and it has the 
greater moment on account of the rough drawing which Emily has made of 
herself and of her dog Keeper.&nbsp; Emily&rsquo;s taste for drawing is a 
pathetic element in her always pathetic life.&nbsp; I have seen a number of
her sketches.&nbsp; There is one in the possession of Mr. Nicholls of 
Keeper and Flossy, the former the bull-dog which followed her to the grave,
the latter a little King Charlie which one of the Miss Robinsons gave to 
Anne.&nbsp; The sketch, however, like most of Emily&rsquo;s drawings, is 
technically full of errors.&nbsp; She was not a born artist, and possibly 
she had not the best opportunities of becoming one by hard work.&nbsp; 
Another drawing before me is of the hawk mentioned in the above fragment; 
and yet another is of the dog Growler, a predecessor of Keeper, which is 
not, however, mentioned in the correspondence.&nbsp; Upon Emily 
Bront&euml;, the poet, I do not propose to write here.&nbsp; She left 
behind her, and Charlotte preserved, a manuscript volume containing the 
whole of the poems in the two collections of her verse, and there are other
poems not yet published.&nbsp; Here, for example, are some verses in which 
the Gondals make a slight reappearance.</p>

<p>There are, indeed, a few fragments, all written in that tiny handwriting
which the girls affected, and bearing various dates from 1833 to 
1840.&nbsp; A new edition of Emily&rsquo;s poems, will, by virtue of these 
verses, have a singular interest for her admirers.&nbsp; With all her gifts
as a poet, however, it is by <i>Wuthering Heights</i> that Emily 
Bront&euml; is best known to the world; and the weirdness and force of that
book suggest an inquiry concerning the influences which produced it.&nbsp; 
Dr. Wright, in his entertaining book, <i>The Bront&euml;s in Ireland</i>, 
recounts the story of Patrick Bront&euml;&rsquo;s origin, and insists that 
it was in listening to her father&rsquo;s anecdotes of his own Irish 
experiences that Emily obtained the weird material of <i>Wuthering 
Heights</i>.&nbsp; It is not, of course, enough to point out that Dr. 
Wright&rsquo;s story of the Irish Bront&euml;s is full of 
contradictions.&nbsp; A number of tales picked up at random from an 
illiterate peasantry might very well abound in inconsistencies, and yet 
contain some measure of truth.&nbsp; But nothing in Dr. Wright&rsquo;s 
narrative is confirmed, save only the fact that Patrick Bront&euml; 
continued throughout his life in some slight measure of correspondence with
his brothers and sisters&mdash;a fact rendered sufficiently evident by a 
perusal of his will.&nbsp; Dr. Wright tells of many visits to Ireland in 
order to trace the Bront&euml; traditions to their source; and yet he had 
not&mdash;in his first edition&mdash;marked the elementary fact that the 
registry of births in County Down records the existence of innumerable 
Bruntys and of not a single Bront&euml;.&nbsp; Dr. Wright probably made his
inquiries with the stories of Emily and Charlotte well in mind.&nbsp; He 
sought for similar traditions, and the quick-witted Irish peasantry gave 
him all that he wanted.&nbsp; <!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>They served up and embellished the current 
traditions of the neighbourhood for his benefit, as the peasantry do 
everywhere for folklore enthusiasts.&nbsp; Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s 
uncle Hugh, we are told, read the <i>Quarterly Review</i> article upon 
<i>Jane Eyre</i>, and, armed with a shillelagh, came to England, in order 
to wreak vengeance upon the writer of the bitter attack.&nbsp; He landed at
Liverpool, walked from Liverpool to Haworth, saw his nieces, who 
&lsquo;gathered round him,&rsquo; and listened to his account of his 
mission.&nbsp; He then went to London and made abundant inquiries&mdash;but
why pursue this ludicrous story further?&nbsp; In the first place, the 
<i>Quarterly Review</i> article was published in December 1848&mdash;after 
Emily was dead, and while Anne was dying.&nbsp; Very soon after the review 
appeared Charlotte was informed of its authorship, and references to Miss 
Rigby and the <i>Quarterly</i> are found more than once in her 
correspondence with Mr. Williams. <a name="citation158"></a><a 
href="#footnote158" class="citation">[158]</a></p>
<p>This is a lengthy digression from the story of Emily&rsquo;s life, but 
it is of moment to discover whether there is any evidence of influences 
other than those which her Yorkshire home afforded.&nbsp; I have discussed 
the matter with Miss Ellen Nussey, and with Mr. Nicholls.&nbsp; Miss Nussey
never, in all her visits to Haworth, heard a single reference to the Irish 
legends related by Dr. Wright, and firmly believes them to be 
mythical.&nbsp; Mr. Nicholls, during the six years that he lived alone at 
the parsonage with his father-in-law, never heard one single word from Mr. 
Bront&euml;&mdash;who was by no means disposed to reticence&mdash;about 
these stories, and is also of opinion that they are purely legendary.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that Emily would have been guilty almost of a 
crime to have based the more sordid part of her narrative upon her 
brother&rsquo;s transgressions.&nbsp; This is sheer nonsense.&nbsp; She 
wrote <i>Wuthering Heights</i> because she was impelled thereto, and the 
book, with all its morbid force <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>and fire, will remain, for all time, as a 
monument of the most striking genius that nineteenth century womanhood has 
given us.&nbsp; It was partly her life in Yorkshire&mdash;the local colour 
was mainly derived from her brief experience as a governess at 
Halifax&mdash;but it was partly, also, the German fiction which she had 
devoured during the Brussels period, that inspired <i>Wuthering 
Heights</i>.</p>
<p>Here, however, are glimpses of Emily Bront&euml; on a more human 
side.</p>

intimating that he and Anne are pretty well too.&nbsp; Emily is much 
obliged to you for the flower seeds.&nbsp; She wishes to know if the

delicate, and should be sown in warm and sheltered situations?&nbsp; Tell

<p>Earlier than this Emily had herself addressed a letter to Miss Nussey, 
and, indeed, the two letters from Emily Bront&euml; to Ellen Nussey which I
print here are, I imagine, the only letters of Emily&rsquo;s in 
existence.&nbsp; Mr. Nicholls informs me that he has never seen a letter in
Emily&rsquo;s handwriting.&nbsp; The following letter is written during 
Charlotte&rsquo;s second stay in Brussels, and at a time when Ellen Nussey 
contemplated joining her there&mdash;a project never carried out.</p>
<blockquote>

wanting in common civility if I did not thank you for your kindness in 
letting me know of an opportunity to send postage free.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have written as you directed, though if next Tuesday means 
to-morrow I fear it will be too late.&nbsp; Charlotte has never mentioned a
word about coming home.&nbsp; If you would go over for half-a-year, perhaps
you might be able to bring her back with you&mdash;otherwise, she might 
vegetate there till the age of Methuselah for mere lack of courage to face 
the voyage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All here are in good health; so was Anne according to her last 
account.&nbsp; The holidays will be here in a week or two, and then, if she
be willing, I will get her to write you a proper letter, a feat that I have
never performed.&mdash;With love and good wishes,</p>

<p>The next letter is written at the time that Charlotte is staying with 
her friend at Mr. Henry Nussey&rsquo;s house at Hathersage in 
Derbyshire.</p>

<p><i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Agnes Grey</i>, &lsquo;by Ellis and 
Acton Bell,&rsquo; were published together in three volumes in 1847.&nbsp; 
The former novel occupied two volumes, and the latter one.&nbsp; By a 
strange freak of publishing, the book was issued as <i>Wuthering 
Heights</i>, vol. I. and II., and <i>Agnes Grey</i>, vol. III., in 
deference, it must be supposed, to the passion for the three volume 
novel.&nbsp; Charlotte refers to the publication in the next letter, which 
contained as inclosure the second preface to <i>Jane Eyre</i>&mdash;the 
preface actually published. <a name="citation161"></a><a 
href="#footnote161" class="citation">[161]</a>&nbsp; An earlier preface, 
entitled &lsquo;A Word to the <i>Quarterly</i>,&rsquo; was cancelled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>December</i> 21<i>st</i>, 1847.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am, for my own part,
dissatisfied with the preface I sent&mdash;I fear it savours of 
flippancy.&nbsp; If you see no objection I should prefer substituting the 
inclosed.&nbsp; It is rather more lengthy, but it expresses something I 
have long wished to express.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Smith is kind indeed to think of sending me <i>The Jar of 
Honey</i>.&nbsp; When I receive the book I will write to him.&nbsp; I 
cannot thank you sufficiently for your letters, and I can give you but a 
faint idea of the pleasure they afford me; they seem to introduce such 
light and life to the torpid retirement where we live like dormice.&nbsp; 
But, understand this distinctly, you must never write to me except when you
have both leisure <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>and inclination.&nbsp; I know your time is too
fully occupied and too valuable to be often at the service of any one 
individual.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not far wrong in your judgment respecting <i>Wuthering 
Heights</i> and <i>Agnes Grey</i>.&nbsp; Ellis has a strong, original mind,
full of strange though sombre power.&nbsp; When he writes poetry that power
speaks in language at once condensed, elaborated, and refined, but in prose
it breaks forth in scenes which shock more than they attract.&nbsp; Ellis 
will improve, however, because he knows his defects.&nbsp; <i>Agnes 
Grey</i> is the mirror of the mind of the writer.&nbsp; The orthography and
punctuation of the books are mortifying to a degree: almost all the errors 
that were corrected in the proof-sheets appear intact in what should have 
been the fair copies.&nbsp; If Mr. Newby always does business in this way, 
few authors would like to have him for their publisher a second 
time.&mdash;Believe me, dear sir, yours respectfully,</p>

<p>When <i>Jane Eyre</i> was performed at a London theatre&mdash;and it has
been more than once adapted for the stage, and performed many hundreds of 
times in England and America&mdash;Charlotte Bront&euml; wrote to her 
friend Mr. Williams as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>February</i> 5<i>th</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;A representation of 
<i>Jane Eyre</i> at a minor theatre would no doubt be a rather afflicting 
spectacle to the author of that work.&nbsp; I suppose all would be wofully 
exaggerated and painfully vulgarised by the actors and actresses on such a 
stage.&nbsp; What, I cannot help asking myself, would they make of Mr. 
Rochester?&nbsp; And the picture my fancy conjures up by way of reply is a 
somewhat humiliating one.&nbsp; What would they make of Jane Eyre?&nbsp; I 
see something very pert and very affected as an answer to that query.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still, were it in my power, I should certainly make a point of 
being myself a witness of the exhibition.&nbsp; Could I go quietly and 
alone, I undoubtedly should go; I should endeavour to endure both rant and 
whine, strut and grimace, for the sake of the useful observations to be 
collected in such a scene.</p>
<p><!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
163</span>&lsquo;As to whether I wish <i>you</i> to go, that is another 
question.&nbsp; I am afraid I have hardly fortitude enough really to wish 
it.&nbsp; One can endure being disgusted with one&rsquo;s own work, but 
that a friend should share the repugnance is unpleasant.&nbsp; Still, I 
know it would interest me to hear both your account of the exhibition and 
any ideas which the effect of the various parts on the spectators might 
suggest to you.&nbsp; In short, I should like to know what you would think,
and to hear what you would say on the subject.&nbsp; But you must not go 
merely to satisfy my curiosity; you must do as you think proper.&nbsp; 
Whatever you decide on will content me: if you do not go, you will be 
spared a vulgarising impression of the book; if you <i>do</i> go, I shall 
perhaps gain a little information&mdash;either alternative has its 
advantage. <a name="citation163"></a><a href="#footnote163" 
class="citation">[163]</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to hear that the second edition is selling, for the 
sake of Messrs. Smith &amp; Elder.&nbsp; I rather feared it would remain on
hand, and occasion loss.&nbsp; <i>Wuthering Heights</i> it appears is 
selling too, and consequently Mr. Newby is getting into marvellously good 
tune with his authors.&mdash;I remain, my dear sir, yours faithfully,</p>

<p>I print the above letter here because of its sequel, which has something
to say of Ellis&mdash;of Emily Bront&euml;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>February</i> 15<i>th</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letter, as you 
may fancy, has given me something to think about.&nbsp; It has presented to
my mind a curious picture, for the description you give is so vivid, I seem
to realise it all.&nbsp; I wanted information and I have got it.&nbsp; You 
have raised the veil from a corner of your great world&mdash;your 
London&mdash;and have shown me a glimpse of what I might call loathsome, 
but which I prefer calling <i>strange</i>.&nbsp; Such, then, is a sample of
what amuses the metropolitan populace!&nbsp; Such is a view of one of their
haunts!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I not say that I would have gone to this theatre and 
witnessed this exhibition if it had been in my power?&nbsp; What 
absurdities people utter when they speak of they know not what!</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must try now to forget entirely what you saw.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to my next book, I suppose it will grow to maturity in <!-- 
page 165--><a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>time, 
as grass grows or corn ripens; but I cannot force it.&nbsp; It makes slow 
progress thus far: it is not every day, nor even every week that I can 
write what is worth reading; but I shall (if not hindered by other matters)
be industrious when the humour comes, and in due time I hope to see such a 
result as I shall not be ashamed to offer you, my publishers, and the 
public.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you not two classes of writers&mdash;the author and the 
bookmaker?&nbsp; And is not the latter more prolific than the former?&nbsp;
Is he not, indeed, wonderfully fertile; but does the public, or the 
publisher even, make much account of his productions?&nbsp; Do not both 
tire of him in time?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it not because authors aim at a style of living better suited 
to merchants, professed gain-seekers, that they are often compelled to 
degenerate to mere bookmakers, and to find the great stimulus of their pen 
in the necessity of earning money?&nbsp; If they were not ashamed to be 
frugal, might they not be more independent?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should much&mdash;very much&mdash;like to take that quiet view 
of the &ldquo;great world&rdquo; you allude to, but I have as yet won no 
right to give myself such a treat: it must be for some future 
day&mdash;when, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Ellis, I imagine, would soon turn
aside from the spectacle in disgust.&nbsp; I do not think he admits it as 
his creed that &ldquo;the proper study of mankind is man&rdquo;&mdash;at 
least not the artificial man of cities.&nbsp; In some points I consider 
Ellis somewhat of a theorist: now and then he broaches ideas which strike 
my sense as much more daring and original than practical; his reason may be
in advance of mine, but certainly it often travels a different road.&nbsp; 
I should say Ellis will not be seen in his full strength till he is seen as
an essayist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I return to you the note inclosed under your cover, it is from 
the editor of the <i>Berwick Warder</i>; he wants a copy of <i>Jane 
Eyre</i> to review.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With renewed thanks for your continued goodness to me,&mdash;I 
remain, my dear sir, yours faithfully,</p>

<p>A short time afterwards the illness came to Emily from which she died 
the same year.&nbsp; Branwell died in September <!-- page 166--><a 
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>1848, and a month 
later Charlotte writes with a heart full of misgivings:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>October</i> 29<i>th</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I am sorry you 
should have been uneasy at my not writing to you ere this, but you must 
remember it is scarcely a week since I received your last, and my life is 
not so varied that in the interim much should have occurred worthy of 
mention.&nbsp; You insist that I should write about myself; this puts me in
straits, for I really have nothing interesting to say about myself.&nbsp; I
think I have now nearly got over the effects of my late illness, and am 
almost restored to my normal condition of health.&nbsp; I sometimes wish 
that it was a little higher, but we ought to be content with such blessings
as we have, and not pine after those that are out of our reach.&nbsp; I 
feel much more uneasy about my sisters than myself just now.&nbsp; 
Emily&rsquo;s cold and cough are very obstinate.&nbsp; I fear she has pain 
in the chest, and I sometimes catch a shortness in her breathing, when she 
has moved at all quickly.&nbsp; She looks very, very thin and pale.&nbsp; 
Her reserved nature occasions me great uneasiness of mind.&nbsp; It is 
useless to question her&mdash;you get no answers.&nbsp; It is still more 
useless to recommend remedies&mdash;they are never adopted.&nbsp; Nor can I
shut my eyes to the fact of Anne&rsquo;s great delicacy of 
constitution.&nbsp; The late sad event has, I feel, made me more 
apprehensive than common.&nbsp; I cannot help feeling much depressed 
sometimes.&nbsp; I try to leave all in God&rsquo;s hands; to trust in His 
goodness; but faith and resignation are difficult to practise under some 
circumstances.&nbsp; The weather has been most unfavourable for invalids of
late: sudden changes of temperature, and cold penetrating winds have been 
frequent here.&nbsp; Should the atmosphere become settled, perhaps a 
favourable effect might be produced on the general health, and those 
harassing coughs and colds be removed.&nbsp; Papa has not quite escaped, 
but he has, so far, stood it out better than any of us.&nbsp; You must not 
mention my going to Brookroyd this winter.&nbsp; I could not, and would 
not, leave home on any account.&nbsp; I am <!-- page 167--><a 
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>truly sorry to hear 
of Miss Heald&rsquo;s serious illness, it seems to me she has been for some
years out of health now.&nbsp; These things make one <i>feel</i> as well as
<i>know</i>, that this world is not our abiding-place.&nbsp; We should not 
knit human ties too close, or clasp human affections too fondly.&nbsp; They
must leave us, or we must leave them, one day.&nbsp; Good-bye for the 
present.&nbsp; God restore health and strength to you and to all who need 
it.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</p>

<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>November</i> 2<i>nd</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have received, 
since I last wrote to you, two papers, the <i>Standard of Freedom</i> and 
the <i>Morning Herald</i>, both containing notices of the Poems; which 
notices, I hope, will at least serve a useful purpose to Mr. Smith in 
attracting public attention to the volume.&nbsp; As critiques, I should 
have thought more of them had they more fully recognised Ellis Bell&rsquo;s
merits; but the lovers of abstract poetry are few in number.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your last letter was very welcome, it was written with so kind an
intention: you made it so interesting in order to divert my mind.&nbsp; I 
should have thanked you for it before now, only that I kept waiting for a 
cheerful day and mood in which to address you, and I grieve to say the 
shadow which has fallen on our quiet home still lingers round it.&nbsp; I 
am better, but others are ill now.&nbsp; Papa is not well, my sister Emily 
has something like slow inflammation of the lungs, and even our old 
servant, who lived with us nearly a quarter of a century, is suffering 
under serious indisposition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would fain hope that Emily is a little better this evening, but
it is difficult to ascertain this.&nbsp; She is a real stoic in illness: 
she neither seeks nor will accept sympathy.&nbsp; To put any questions, to 
offer any aid, is to annoy; she will not yield a step before pain or 
sickness till forced; not one of her ordinary avocations will she 
voluntarily renounce.&nbsp; You must look on and see her do what she is 
unfit to do, and not dare to say a word&mdash;a painful necessity for those
to whom her health and existence are as precious as the life in their 
veins.&nbsp; When she is ill there seems to <!-- page 168--><a 
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>be no sunshine in the
world for me.&nbsp; The tie of sister is near and dear indeed, and I think 
a certain harshness in her powerful and peculiar character only makes me 
cling to her more.&nbsp; But this is all family egotism (so to 
speak)&mdash;excuse it, and, above all, never allude to it, or to the name 
Emily, when you write to me.&nbsp; I do not always show your letters, but I
never withhold them when they are inquired after.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry I cannot claim for the name Bront&euml; the honour of 
being connected with the notice in the <i>Bradford Observer</i>.&nbsp; That
paper is in the hands of dissenters, and I should think the best articles 
are usually written by one or two intelligent dissenting ministers in the 
town.&nbsp; Alexander Harris <a name="citation168a"></a><a 
href="#footnote168a" class="citation">[168a]</a> is fortunate in your 
encouragement, as Currer Bell once was.&nbsp; He has not forgotten the 
first letter he received from you, declining indeed his MS. of <i>The 
Professor</i>, but in terms so different from those in which the rejections
of the other publishers had been expressed&mdash;with so much more sense 
and kind feeling, it took away the sting of disappointment and kindled new 
hope in his mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Currer Bell might expostulate with you again about thinking too 
well of him, but he refrains; he prefers acknowledging that the expression 
of a fellow creature&rsquo;s regard&mdash;even if more than he 
deserves&mdash;does him good: it gives him a sense of content.&nbsp; 
Whatever portion of the tribute is unmerited on his part, would, he is 
aware, if exposed to the test of daily acquaintance, disperse like a broken
bubble, but he has confidence that a portion, however minute, of solid 
friendship would remain behind, and that portion he reckons amongst his 
treasures.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad, by-the-bye, to hear that <i>Madeline</i> is come out 
at last, and was happy to see a favourable notice of that work and of 
<i>The Three Paths</i> in the <i>Morning Herald</i>.&nbsp; I wish Miss 
Kavanagh all success. <a name="citation168b"></a><a href="#footnote168b"

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>November</i> 22<i>nd</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I put your most 
friendly letter into Emily&rsquo;s hands as soon as I had myself perused 
it, taking care, however, not to say a word in favour of 
hom&oelig;opathy&mdash;that would not have answered.&nbsp; It is best 
usually to leave her to form her own judgment, and <i>especially</i> not to
advocate the side you wish her to favour; if you do, she is sure to lean in
the opposite direction, and ten to one will argue herself into 
non-compliance.&nbsp; Hitherto she has refused medicine, rejected medical 
advice; no reasoning, no entreaty, has availed to induce her to see a 
physician.&nbsp; After reading your letter she said, &ldquo;Mr. 
Williams&rsquo;s intention was kind and good, but he was under a delusion: 
Hom&oelig;opathy was only another form of quackery.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet she 
may reconsider this opinion and come to a different conclusion; her second 
thoughts are often the best.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The <i>North American Review</i> is worth reading; there is no 
mincing the matter there.&nbsp; What a bad set the Bells must be!&nbsp; 
What appalling books they write!&nbsp; To-day, as Emily appeared a little 
easier, I thought the <i>Review</i> would amuse her, so I read it aloud to 
her and Anne.&nbsp; As I sat between them at our quiet but now somewhat 
melancholy fireside, I studied the two ferocious authors.&nbsp; Ellis, the 
&ldquo;man of uncommon talents, but dogged, brutal, and morose,&rdquo; sat 
leaning back in his easy chair drawing his impeded breath as he best could,
and looking, alas! piteously pale and wasted; it is not his wont to laugh, 
but he smiled half-amused and half in scorn as he listened.&nbsp; Acton 
<!-- page 170--><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
170</span>was sewing, no emotion ever stirs him to loquacity, so he only 
smiled too, dropping at the same time a single word of calm amazement to 
hear his character so darkly portrayed.&nbsp; I wonder what the reviewer 
would have thought of his own sagacity could he have beheld the pair as I 
did.&nbsp; Vainly, too, might he have looked round for the masculine 
partner in the firm of &ldquo;Bell &amp; Co.&rdquo;&nbsp; How I laugh in my
sleeve when I read the solemn assertions that <i>Jane Eyre</i> was written 
in partnership, and that it &ldquo;bears the marks of more than one mind 
and one sex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The wise critics would certainly sink a degree in their own 
estimation if they knew that yours or Mr. Smith&rsquo;s was the first 
masculine hand that touched the MS. of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and that till you 
or he read it no masculine eye had scanned a line of its contents, no 
masculine ear heard a phrase from its pages.&nbsp; However, the view they 
take of the matter rather pleases me than otherwise.&nbsp; If they like, I 
am not unwilling they should think a dozen ladies and gentlemen aided at 
the compilation of the book.&nbsp; Strange patchwork it must seem to 
them&mdash;this chapter being penned by Mr., and that by Miss or Mrs. Bell;
that character or scene being delineated by the husband, that other by the 
wife!&nbsp; The gentleman, of course, doing the rough work, the lady 
getting up the finer parts.&nbsp; I admire the idea vastly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have read <i>Madeline</i>.&nbsp; It is a fine pearl in simple 
setting.&nbsp; Julia Kavanagh has my esteem; I would rather know her than 
many far more brilliant personages.&nbsp; Somehow my heart leans more to 
her than to Eliza Lynn, for instance.&nbsp; Not that I have read either 
<i>Amymone</i> or <i>Azeth</i>, but I have seen extracts from them which I 
found it literally impossible to digest.&nbsp; They presented to my 
imagination Lytton Bulwer in petticoats&mdash;an overwhelming vision.&nbsp;
By-the-bye, the American critic talks admirable sense about 
Bulwer&mdash;candour obliges me to confess that.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must abruptly bid you good-bye for the present.&mdash;Yours 
sincerely,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>December</i> 7<i>th</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I duly received Dr.
Curie&rsquo;s work on Hom&oelig;opathy, and ought to apologise for having 
forgotten to thank you for it.&nbsp; I will return it when I have given it 
a more attentive perusal than I have yet had leisure to do.&nbsp; My sister
has read it, but as yet she remains unshaken in her former opinion: she 
will not admit there can be efficacy in such a system.&nbsp; Were I in her 
place, it appears to me that I should be glad to give it a trial, confident
that it can scarcely do harm and might do good.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can give no favourable report of Emily&rsquo;s state.&nbsp; My 
father is very despondent about her.&nbsp; Anne and I cherish hope as well 
as we can, but her appearance and her symptoms tend to crush that 
feeling.&nbsp; Yet I argue that the present emaciation, cough, weakness, 
shortness of breath are the results of inflammation, now, I trust, 
subsided, and that with time these ailments will gradually leave her.&nbsp;
But my father shakes his head and speaks of others of our family once 
similarly afflicted, for whom he likewise persisted in hoping against hope,
and who are now removed where hope and fear fluctuate no more.&nbsp; There 
were, however, differences between their case and hers&mdash;important 
differences I think.&nbsp; I must cling to the expectation of her recovery,
I cannot renounce it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Much would I give to have the opinion of a skilful professional 
man.&nbsp; It is easy, my dear sir, to say there is nothing in medicine, 
and that physicians are useless, but we naturally wish to procure aid for 
those we love when we see them suffer; most painful is it to sit still, 
look on, and do nothing.&nbsp; Would that my sister added to her many great
qualities the humble one of tractability!&nbsp; I have again and again 
incurred her displeasure by urging the necessity of seeking advice, and I 
fear I must yet incur it again and again.&nbsp; Let me leave the subject; I
have no right thus to make you a sharer in our sorrow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am indeed surprised that Mr. Newby should say that he is to 
publish another work by Ellis and Acton Bell.&nbsp; Acton has had quite 
enough of him.&nbsp; I think I <i>have</i> before intimated that that <!-- 
page 172--><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>author 
never more intends to have Mr. Newby for a publisher.&nbsp; Not only does 
he seem to forget that engagements made should be fulfilled, but by a 
system of petty and contemptible man&oelig;uvring he throws an air of 
charlatanry over the works of which he has the management.&nbsp; This does 
not suit the &ldquo;Bells&rdquo;: they have their own rude north-country 
ideas of what is delicate, honourable, and gentlemanlike.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Newby&rsquo;s conduct in no sort corresponds with these notions; 
they have found him&mdash;I will not say what they have found him.&nbsp; 
Two words that would exactly suit him are at my pen point, but I shall not 
take the trouble to employ them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ellis Bell is at present in no condition to trouble himself with 
thoughts either of writing or publishing.&nbsp; Should it please Heaven to 
restore his health and strength, he reserves to himself the right of 
deciding whether or not Mr. Newby has forfeited every claim to his second 
work.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not yet read the second number of <i>Pendennis</i>.&nbsp; 
The first I thought rich in indication of ease, resource, promise; but it 
is not Thackeray&rsquo;s way to develop his full power all at once.&nbsp; 
<i>Vanity Fair</i> began very quietly&mdash;it was quiet all through, but 
the stream as it rolled gathered a resistless volume and force.&nbsp; Such,
I doubt not, will be the case with <i>Pendennis</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must forget what I said about Eliza Lynn.&nbsp; She may be 
the best of human beings, and I am but a narrow-minded fool to express 
prejudice against a person I have never seen.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letter seems 
to relieve me from a difficulty and to open my way.&nbsp; I know it would 
be useless to consult Drs. Elliotson or Forbes: my sister would not see the
most skilful physician in England if he were brought to her just now, nor 
would she follow his prescription.&nbsp; With regard to <!-- page 173--><a

has at least admitted that it cannot do much harm; perhaps if I get the

made.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I mentioned your 
coming here to Emily as a mere suggestion, with the faint hope that the 
prospect might cheer her, as she really esteems you perhaps more than <!-- 
page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>any 
other person out of this house.&nbsp; I found, however, it would not do; 
any, the slightest excitement or putting out of the way is not to be 
thought of, and indeed I do not think the journey in this unsettled 
weather, with the walk from Keighley and walk back, at all advisable for 
yourself.&nbsp; Yet I should have liked to see you, and so would 
Anne.&nbsp; Emily continues much the same; yesterday I thought her a little
better, but to-day she is not so well.&nbsp; I hope still, for I 
<i>must</i> hope&mdash;she is dear to me as life.&nbsp; If I let the 
faintness of despair reach my heart I shall become worthless.&nbsp; The 
attack was, I believe, in the first place, inflammation of the lungs; it 
ought to have been met promptly in time.&nbsp; She is too 
intractable.&nbsp; I <i>do</i> wish I knew her state and feelings more 
clearly.&nbsp; The fever is not so high as it was, but the pain in the 
side, the cough, the emaciation are there still.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;Emily suffers no 
more from pain or weakness now.&nbsp; She will never suffer more in this 
world.&nbsp; She is gone, after a hard, short conflict.&nbsp; She died on 
<i>Tuesday</i>, the very day I wrote to you.&nbsp; I thought it very 
possible she might be with us still for weeks, and a few hours afterwards 
she was in eternity.&nbsp; Yes, there is no Emily in time or on earth 
now.&nbsp; Yesterday we put her poor, wasted, mortal frame quietly under 
the church pavement.&nbsp; We are very calm at present.&nbsp; Why should we
be otherwise?&nbsp; The anguish of seeing her suffer is over; the spectacle
of the pains of death is gone by; the funeral day is past.&nbsp; We feel 
she is at peace.&nbsp; No need now to tremble for the hard frost and the 
keen wind.&nbsp; Emily does not feel them.&nbsp; She died in a time of 
promise.&nbsp; We saw her taken from life in its prime.&nbsp; But it is 
God&rsquo;s will, and the place where she is gone is better than she has 
left.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>December</i> 25<i>th</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I will write to you
more at length when my <!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>heart can find a little rest&mdash;now I can 
only thank you very briefly for your letter, which seemed to me eloquent in
its sincerity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Emily is nowhere here now, her wasted mortal remains are taken 
out of the house.&nbsp; We have laid her cherished head under the church 
aisle beside my mother&rsquo;s, my two sisters&rsquo;&mdash;dead long 
ago&mdash;and my poor, hapless brother&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But a small remnant 
of the race is left&mdash;so my poor father thinks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, the loss is ours, not hers, and some sad comfort I take, as
I hear the wind blow and feel the cutting keenness of the frost, in knowing
that the elements bring her no more suffering; their severity cannot reach 
her grave; her fever is quieted, her restlessness soothed, her deep, hollow
cough is hushed for ever; we do not hear it in the night nor listen for it 
in the morning; we have not the conflict of the strangely strong spirit and
the fragile frame before us&mdash;relentless conflict&mdash;once seen, 
never to be forgotten.&nbsp; A dreary calm reigns round us, in the midst of
which we seek resignation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My father and my sister Anne are far from well.&nbsp; As for me, 
God has hitherto most graciously sustained me; so far I have felt adequate 
to bear my own burden and even to offer a little help to others.&nbsp; I am
not ill; I can get through daily duties, and do something towards keeping 
hope and energy alive in our mourning household.&nbsp; My father says to me
almost hourly, &ldquo;Charlotte, you must bear up, I shall sink if you fail
me&rdquo;; these words, you can conceive, are a stimulus to nature.&nbsp; 
The sight, too, of my sister Anne&rsquo;s very still but deep sorrow wakens
in me such fear for her that I dare not falter.&nbsp; Somebody <i>must</i> 
cheer the rest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So I will not now ask why Emily was torn from us in the fulness 
of our attachment, rooted up in the prime of her own days, in the promise 
of her powers; why her existence now lies like a field of green corn 
trodden down, like a tree in full bearing struck at the root.&nbsp; I will 
only say, sweet is rest after labour and calm after tempest, and repeat 
again and again that Emily knows that now.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>January</i> 2<i>nd</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Untoward 
circumstances come to me, I think, less painfully than pleasant ones would 
just now.&nbsp; The lash of the <i>Quarterly</i>, however severely applied,
cannot sting&mdash;as its praise probably would not elate me.&nbsp; Currer 
Bell feels a sorrowful independence of reviews and reviewers; their 
approbation might indeed fall like an additional weight on his heart, but 
their censure has no bitterness for him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My sister Anne sends the accompanying answer to the letter 
received through you the other day; will you be kind enough to post 
it?&nbsp; She is not well yet, nor is papa, both are suffering under severe
influenza colds.&nbsp; My letters had better be brief at present&mdash;they
cannot be cheerful.&nbsp; I am, however, still sustained.&nbsp; While 
looking with dismay on the desolation sickness and death have wrought in 
our home, I can combine with awe of God&rsquo;s judgments a sense of 
gratitude for his mercies.&nbsp; Yet life has become very void, and hope 
has proved a strange traitor; when I shall again be able to put confidence 
in her suggestions, I know not: she kept whispering that Emily would not, 
<i>could</i> not die, and where is she now?&nbsp; Out of my reach, out of 
my world&mdash;torn from me.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Hitherto, I have 
always forgotten to acknowledge the receipt of the parcel from 
Cornhill.&nbsp; It came at a time when I could not open it nor think of it;
its contents are still a mystery.&nbsp; I will not taste, till I can enjoy 
them.&nbsp; I looked at it the other day.&nbsp; It reminded me too sharply 
of the time when the first parcel arrived last October: Emily was then 
beginning to be ill&mdash;the opening of the parcel and examination of the 
books cheered her; their perusal occupied her for many a weary day.&nbsp; 
The very evening before her last morning dawned I read to her one of 
Emerson&rsquo;s essays.&nbsp; I read on, till I found <!-- page 177--><a 
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>she was not 
listening&mdash;I thought to recommence next day.&nbsp; Next day, the first
glance at her face told me what would happen before night-fall.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>November</i> 19<i>th</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am very sorry to 
hear that Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s illness has proved so much more serious than 
was anticipated, but I do hope he is now better.&nbsp; That he should be 
quite well cannot be as yet expected, for I believe rheumatic fever is a 
complaint slow to leave the system it has invaded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now that I have almost formed the resolution of coming to London,
the thought begins to present itself to me under a pleasant aspect.&nbsp; 
At first it was sad; it recalled the last time I went and with whom, and to
whom I came home, and in what dear companionship I again and again narrated
all that had been seen, heard, and uttered in that visit.&nbsp; Emily would
never go into any sort of society herself, and whenever I went I could on 
my return communicate to her a pleasure that suited her, by giving the 
distinct faithful impression of each scene I had witnessed.&nbsp; When 
pressed to go, she would sometimes say, &ldquo;What is the use?&nbsp; 
Charlotte will bring it all home to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And indeed I delighted
to please her thus.&nbsp; My occupation is gone now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall come to be lectured.&nbsp; I perceive you are ready with 
animadversion; you are not at all well satisfied on some points, so I will 
open my ears to hear, nor will I close my heart against conviction; but I 
forewarn you, I have my own doctrines, not acquired, but innate, some that 
I fear cannot be rooted up without tearing away all the soil from which 
they spring, and leaving only unproductive rock for new seed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have read the <i>Caxtons</i>, I have looked at <i>Fanny 
Hervey</i>.&nbsp; I think I will not write what I think of 
either&mdash;should I see you I will speak it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take a hundred, take a thousand of such works and weigh them in 
the balance against a page of Thackeray.&nbsp; I hope Mr. Thackeray is 
recovered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The <i>Sun</i>, the <i>Morning Herald</i>, and the <i>Critic</i> 
came this <!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
178</span>morning.&nbsp; None of them express disappointment from 
<i>Shirley</i>, or on the whole compare her disadvantageously with 
<i>Jane</i>.&nbsp; It strikes me that those worthies&mdash;the 
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, <i>Spectator</i>, <i>Economist</i>, made haste to be
first with their notices that they might give the tone; if so, their 
man&oelig;uvre has not yet quite succeeded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The <i>Critic</i>, our old friend, is a friend still.&nbsp; Why 
does the pulse of pain beat in every pleasure?&nbsp; Ellis and Acton Bell 
are referred to, and where are they?&nbsp; I will not repine.&nbsp; Faith 
whispers they are not in those graves to which imagination turns&mdash;the 
feeling, thinking, the inspired natures are beyond earth, in a region more 
glorious.&nbsp; I believe them blessed.&nbsp; I think, I <i>will</i> think,
my loss has been <i>their</i> gain.&nbsp; Does it weary you that I refer to
them?&nbsp; If so, forgive me.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. 
Bront&euml;</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Before closing this I glanced over the letter inclosed under your
cover.&nbsp; Did you read it?&nbsp; It is from a lady, not quite an old 
maid, but nearly one, she says; no signature or date; a queer, but 
good-natured production, it made me half cry, half laugh.&nbsp; I am sure 
<i>Shirley</i> has been exciting enough for her, and too exciting.&nbsp; I 
cannot well reply to the letter since it bears no address, and I am 
glad&mdash;I should not know what to say.&nbsp; She is not sure whether I 
am a gentleman or not, but I fancy she thinks so.&nbsp; Have you any idea 
who she is?&nbsp; If I were a gentleman and like my heroes, she suspects 
she should fall in love with me.&nbsp; She had better not.&nbsp; It would 
be a pity to cause such a waste of sensibility.&nbsp; You and Mr. Smith 
would not let me announce myself as a single gentleman of mature age in my 
preface, but if you had permitted it, a great many elderly spinsters would 
have been pleased.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last words that I have to say concerning Emily are contained in a 
letter to me from Miss Ellen Nussey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;So very little is known of Emily Bront&euml;,&rsquo; she writes, 
&lsquo;that every little detail awakens an interest.&nbsp; Her extreme 
reserve seemed impenetrable, yet she was intensely lovable; she invited 
<!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
179</span>confidence in her moral power.&nbsp; Few people have the gift of 
looking and smiling as she could look and smile.&nbsp; One of her rare 
expressive looks was something to remember through life, there was such a 
depth of soul and feeling, and yet a shyness of revealing herself&mdash;a 
strength of self-containment seen in no other.&nbsp; She was in the 
strictest sense a law unto herself, and a heroine in keeping to her 
law.&nbsp; She and gentle Anne were to be seen twined together as united 
statues of power and humility.&nbsp; They were to be seen with their arms 
lacing each other in their younger days whenever their occupations 
permitted their union.&nbsp; On the top of a moor or in a deep glen Emily 
was a child in spirit for glee and enjoyment; or when thrown entirely on 
her own resources to do a kindness, she could be vivacious in conversation 
and enjoy giving pleasure.&nbsp; A spell of mischief also lurked in her on 
occasions when out on the moors.&nbsp; She enjoyed leading Charlotte where 
she would not dare to go of her own free-will.&nbsp; Charlotte had a mortal
dread of unknown animals, and it was Emily&rsquo;s pleasure to lead her 
into close vicinity, and then to tell her of how and of what she had done, 
laughing at her horror with great amusement.&nbsp; If Emily wanted a book 
she might have left in the sitting-room she would dart in again without 
looking at any one, especially if any guest were present.&nbsp; Among the 
curates, Mr. Weightman was her only exception for any conventional 
courtesy.&nbsp; The ability with which she took up music was amazing; the 
style, the touch, and the expression was that of a professor absorbed heart
and soul in his theme.&nbsp; The two dogs, Keeper and Flossy, were always 
in quiet waiting by the side of Emily and Anne during their breakfast of 
Scotch oatmeal and milk, and always had a share handed down to them at the 
close of the meal.&nbsp; Poor old Keeper, Emily&rsquo;s faithful friend and
worshipper, seemed to understand her like a human being.&nbsp; One evening,
when the four friends were sitting closely round the fire in the 
sitting-room, Keeper forced himself in between Charlotte and Emily and 
mounted himself on Emily&rsquo;s lap; finding the space too limited for his
comfort he pressed himself forward on to the guest&rsquo;s knees, making 
himself quite comfortable.&nbsp; Emily&rsquo;s <!-- page 180--><a 
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>heart was won by the 
unresisting endurance of the visitor, little guessing that she herself, 
being in close contact, was the inspiring cause of submission to 
Keeper&rsquo;s preference.&nbsp; Sometimes Emily would delight in showing 
off Keeper&mdash;make him frantic in action, and roar with the voice of a 
lion.&nbsp; It was a terrifying exhibition within the walls of an ordinary 
sitting-room.&nbsp; Keeper was a solemn mourner at Emily&rsquo;s funeral 
and never recovered his cheerfulness.&rsquo;</p>

181</span>CHAPTER VII: ANNE BRONT&Euml;</h2>
<p>It can scarcely be doubted that Anne Bront&euml;&rsquo;s two novels, 
<i>Agnes Grey</i> and <i>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</i>, would have long 
since fallen into oblivion but for the inevitable association with the 
romances of her two greater sisters.&nbsp; While this may he taken for 
granted, it is impossible not to feel, even at the distance of half a 
century, a sense of Anne&rsquo;s personal charm.&nbsp; Gentleness is a word
always associated with her by those who knew her.&nbsp; When Mr. Nicholls 
saw what professed to be a portrait of Anne in a magazine article, he 
wrote: &lsquo;What an awful caricature of the dear, gentle Anne 
Bront&euml;!&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Nicholls has a portrait of Anne in his 
possession, drawn by Charlotte, which he pronounces to be an admirable 
likeness, and this does convey the impression of a sweet and gentle 
nature.</p>
<p>Anne, as we have seen, was taken in long clothes from Thornton to 
Haworth.&nbsp; Her godmother was a Miss Outhwaite, a fact I learn from an 
inscription in Anne&rsquo;s <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;<i>Miss Outhwaite to her goddaughter</i>, <i>Anne Bront&euml;</i>, 
<i>July </i>13<i>th</i>, 1827.&rsquo;&nbsp; Miss Outhwaite was not 
forgetful of her goddaughter, for by her will she left Anne &pound;200.</p>
<p>There is a sampler worked by Anne, bearing date January 23rd, 1830, and 
there is a later book than the Prayer Book, with Anne&rsquo;s name in it, 
and, as might be expected, it is a good-conduct prize.&nbsp; <i>Prize for 
good conduct presented to Miss A. Bront&euml; with Miss Wooler&rsquo;s kind
love</i>, <!-- page 182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
182</span><i>Roe Head</i>, <i>Dec.</i> 14<i>th</i>, 1836, is the

<p>Apart from the correspondence we know little more than this&mdash;that 
Anne was the least assertive of the three sisters, and that she was more 
distinctly a general favourite.&nbsp; We have Charlotte&rsquo;s own word 
for it that even the curates ventured upon &lsquo;sheep&rsquo;s eyes&rsquo;
at Anne.&nbsp; We know all too little of her two experiences as governess, 
first at Blake Hall with Mrs. Ingham, and later at Thorp Green with Mrs. 
Robinson.&nbsp; The painful episode of Branwell&rsquo;s madness came to 
disturb her sojourn at the latter place, but long afterwards her old 
pupils, the Misses Robinson, called to see her at Haworth; and one of them,
who became a Mrs. Clapham of Keighley, always retained the most kindly 
memories of her gentle governess.</p>

<p>With the exception of these two uncomfortable episodes as governess, 
Anne would seem to have had no experience of the larger world.&nbsp; Even 
before Anne&rsquo;s death, Charlotte had visited Brussels, London, and 
Hathersage (in Derbyshire).&nbsp; Anne never, I think, set foot out of her 
native county, although she was the only one of her family to die away from
home.&nbsp; Of her correspondence I have only the two following 
letters:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>October</i> 4<i>th</i>, 1847.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Nussey</span>,&mdash;Many thanks
to you for your unexpected and welcome epistle.&nbsp; Charlotte is well, 
and meditates writing to you.&nbsp; Happily for all parties the east wind 
no longer prevails.&nbsp; During its continuance she complained of its 
influence as usual.&nbsp; I too suffered from it in some degree, as I 
always do, more or less; but this time, it brought me no reinforcement of 
colds and coughs, which is what I dread the most.&nbsp; Emily considers it 
a very uninteresting wind, but it does not affect her nervous system.&nbsp;
Charlotte <!-- page 183--><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
183</span>agrees with me in thinking the --- <a name="citation183a"></a><a 
href="#footnote183a" class="citation">[183a]</a> a very provoking 
affair.&nbsp; You are quite mistaken about her parasol; she affirms she 
brought it back, and I can bear witness to the fact, having seen it 
yesterday in her possession.&nbsp; As for my book, I have no wish to see it
again till I see you along with it, and then it will be welcome enough for 
the sake of the bearer.&nbsp; We are all here much as you left us.&nbsp; I 
have no news to tell you, except that Mr. Nicholls begged a holiday and 
went to Ireland three or four weeks ago, and is not expected back till 
Saturday; but that, I dare say, is no news at all.&nbsp; We were all and 
severally pleased and gratified for your kind and judiciously selected 
presents, from papa down to Tabby, or down to myself, perhaps I ought 
rather to say.&nbsp; The crab-cheese is excellent, and likely to be very 
useful, but I don&rsquo;t intend to need it.&nbsp; It is not choice but 
necessity has induced me to choose such a tiny sheet of paper for my 
letter, having none more suitable at hand; but perhaps it will contain as 
much as you need wish to read, and I to write, for I find I have nothing 
more to say, except that your little Tabby must be a charming little 
creature.&nbsp; That is all, for as Charlotte is writing, or about to write
to you herself, I need not send any messages from her.&nbsp; Therefore 
accept my best love.&nbsp; I must not omit the Major&rsquo;s <a 
name="citation183b"></a><a href="#footnote183b" class="citation">[183b]</a>
compliments.&nbsp; And&mdash;Believe me to be your affectionate friend,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Nussey</span>,&mdash;I am not 
going to give you a &ldquo;nice <i>long</i> letter&rdquo;&mdash;on the 
contrary, I mean to content myself with a shabby little note, to be 
ingulfed in a letter of Charlotte&rsquo;s, which will, of course, be 
infinitely more acceptable to you than any production of mine, though I do 
not question your friendly regard for me, or the indulgent welcome you 
would accord to a missive of mine, even without a more agreeable companion 
to <!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
184</span>back it; but you must know there is a lamentable deficiency in my
organ of language, which makes me almost as bad a hand at writing as 
talking, unless I have something particular to say.&nbsp; I have now, 
however, to thank you and your friend for your kind letter and her pretty 
watch-guards, which I am sure we shall all of us value the more for being 
the work of her own hands.&nbsp; You do not tell us how <i>you</i> bear the
present unfavourable weather.&nbsp; We are all cut up by this cruel east 
wind.&nbsp; Most of us, i.e. Charlotte, Emily, and I have had the 
influenza, or a bad cold instead, twice over within the space of a few 
weeks.&nbsp; Papa has had it once.&nbsp; Tabby has escaped it 
altogether.&nbsp; I have no news to tell you, for we have been nowhere, 
seen no one, and done nothing (to speak of) since you were here&mdash;and 
yet we contrive to be busy from morning till night.&nbsp; Flossy is fatter 
than ever, but still active enough to relish a sheep-hunt.&nbsp; I hope you
and your circle have been more fortunate in the matter of colds than we 
have.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With kind regards to all,&mdash;I remain, dear Miss Nussey, yours
ever affectionately,</p>

<p><i>Agnes Grey</i>, as we have noted, was published by Newby, in one 
volume, in 1847.&nbsp; <i>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</i> was issued by the
same publisher, in three volumes, in 1848.&nbsp; It is not generally known 
that <i>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</i> went into a second edition the same
year; and I should have pronounced it incredible, were not a copy of the 
later issue in my possession, that Anne Bront&euml; had actually written a 
preface to this edition.&nbsp; The fact is entirely ignored in the 
correspondence.&nbsp; The preface in question makes it quite clear, if any 
evidence of that were necessary, that Anne had her brother in mind in 
writing the book.&nbsp; &lsquo;I could not be understood to suppose,&rsquo;
she says, &lsquo;that the proceedings of the unhappy scapegrace, with his 
few profligate companions I have here introduced, are a specimen of the 
common practices of society: the case is an extreme one, as I trusted none 
would fail to perceive; but I <!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>knew that such characters do exist, and if I 
have warned one rash youth from following in their steps, or prevented one 
thoughtless girl from falling into the very natural error of my heroine, 
the book has not been written in vain.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;One word more 
and I have done,&rsquo; she continues.&nbsp; &lsquo;Respecting the 
author&rsquo;s identity, I would have it to be distinctly understood that 
Acton Bell is neither Currer nor Ellis Bell, and, therefore, let not his 
faults be attributed to them.&nbsp; As to whether the name is real or 
fictitious, it cannot greatly signify to those who know him only by his 
works.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>January</i> 18<i>th</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;In sitting down to 
write to you I feel as if I were doing a wrong and a selfish thing.&nbsp; I
believe I ought to discontinue my correspondence with you till times 
change, and the tide of calamity which of late days has set so strongly in 
against us takes a turn.&nbsp; But the fact is, sometimes I feel it 
absolutely necessary to unburden my mind.&nbsp; To papa I must only speak 
cheeringly, to Anne only encouragingly&mdash;to you I may give some hint of
the dreary truth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anne and I sit alone and in seclusion as you fancy us, but we do 
not study.&nbsp; Anne cannot study now, she can scarcely read; she occupies
Emily&rsquo;s chair; she does not get well.&nbsp; A week ago we sent for a 
medical man of skill and experience from Leeds to see her.&nbsp; He 
examined her with the stethoscope.&nbsp; His report I forbear to dwell on 
for the present&mdash;even skilful physicians have often been mistaken in 
their conjectures.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My first impulse was to hasten her away to a warmer climate, but 
this was forbidden: she must not travel; she is not to stir from the house 
this winter; the temperature of her room is to be kept constantly 
equal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had leave been given to try change of air and scene, I should 
hardly have known how to act.&nbsp; I could not possibly leave papa; and 
when I mentioned his accompanying us, the bare thought distressed him too 
much to be dwelt upon.&nbsp; Papa <!-- page 186--><a 
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>is now upwards of 
seventy years of age; his habits for nearly thirty years have been those of
absolute retirement; any change in them is most repugnant to him, and 
probably could not, at this time especially when the hand of God is so 
heavy upon his old age, be ventured upon without danger.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When we lost Emily I thought we had drained the very dregs of our
cup of trial, but now when I hear Anne cough as Emily coughed, I tremble 
lest there should be exquisite bitterness yet to taste.&nbsp; However, I 
must not look forwards, nor must I look backwards.&nbsp; Too often I feel 
like one crossing an abyss on a narrow plank&mdash;a glance round might 
quite unnerve.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So circumstanced, my dear sir, what claim have I on your 
friendship, what right to the comfort of your letters?&nbsp; My literary 
character is effaced for the time, and it is by that only you know 
me.&nbsp; Care of papa and Anne is necessarily my chief present object in 
life, to the exclusion of all that could give me interest with my 
publishers or their connections.&nbsp; Should Anne get better, I think I 
could rally and become Currer Bell once more, but if otherwise, I look no 
farther: sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anne is very patient in her illness, as patient as Emily was 
unflinching.&nbsp; I recall one sister and look at the other with a sort of
reverence as well as affection&mdash;under the test of suffering neither 
has faltered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All the days of this winter have gone by darkly and heavily like 
a funeral train.&nbsp; Since September, sickness has not quitted the 
house.&nbsp; It is strange it did not use to be so, but I suspect now all 
this has been coming on for years.&nbsp; Unused, any of us, to the 
possession of robust health, we have not noticed the gradual approaches of 
decay; we did not know its symptoms: the little cough, the small appetite, 
the tendency to take cold at every variation of atmosphere have been 
regarded as things of course.&nbsp; I see them in another light now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you answer this, write to me as you would to a person in an 
average state of tranquillity and happiness.&nbsp; I want to keep myself as
firm and calm as I can.&nbsp; While papa and Anne want me, I hope, I pray, 
never to fail them.&nbsp; Were I to see you I should <!-- page 187--><a 
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>endeavour to converse
on ordinary topics, and I should wish to write on the same&mdash;besides, 
it will be less harassing to yourself to address me as usual.</p>
<p>&lsquo;May God long preserve to you the domestic treasures you value; 
and when bereavement at last comes, may He give you strength to bear 
it.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>

<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>February</i> 1<i>st</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Anne seems so 
tranquil this morning, so free from pain and fever, and looks and speaks so
like herself in health, that I too feel relieved, and I take advantage of 
the respite to write to you, hoping that my letter may reflect something of
the comparative peace I feel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whether my hopes are quite fallacious or not, I do not know; but 
sometimes I fancy that the remedies prescribed by Mr. Teale, and 
approved&mdash;as I was glad to learn&mdash;by Dr. Forbes, are working a 
good result.&nbsp; Consumption, I am aware, is a flattering malady, but 
certainly Anne&rsquo;s illness has of late assumed a less alarming 
character than it had in the beginning: the hectic is allayed; the cough 
gives a more frequent reprieve.&nbsp; Could I but believe she would live 
two years&mdash;a year longer, I should be thankful: I dreaded the terrors 
of the swift messenger which snatched Emily from us, as it seemed, in a few
days.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The parcel came yesterday.&nbsp; You and Mr. Smith do nothing by 
halves.&nbsp; Neither of you care for being thanked, so I will keep my 
gratitude in my own mind.&nbsp; The choice of books is perfect.&nbsp; Papa 
is at this moment reading Macaulay&rsquo;s <i>History</i>, which he had 
wished to see.&nbsp; Anne is engaged with one of Frederika Bremer&rsquo;s 
tales.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I could send a parcel in return; I had hoped to have had 
one by this time ready to despatch.&nbsp; When I saw you and Mr. Smith in 
London, I little thought of all that was to come between July and Spring: 
how my thoughts were to be caught away from imagination, enlisted and 
absorbed in realities the most cruel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will tell you what I want to do; it is to show you the first 
<!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
188</span>volume of my MS., which I have copied.&nbsp; In reading Mary 
Barton (a clever though painful tale) I was a little dismayed to find 
myself in some measure anticipated both in subject and incident.&nbsp; I 
should like to have your opinion on this point, and to know whether the 
resemblance appears as considerable to a stranger as it does to 
myself.&nbsp; I should wish also to have the benefit of such general 
strictures and advice as you choose to give.&nbsp; Shall I therefore send 
the MS. when I return the first batch of books?</p>
<p>&lsquo;But remember, if I show it to you it is on two conditions: the 
first, that you give me a faithful opinion&mdash;I do not promise to be 
swayed by it, but I should like to have it; the second, that you show it 
and speak of it to <i>none</i> but Mr. Smith.&nbsp; I have always a great 
horror of premature announcements&mdash;they may do harm and can never do 
good.&nbsp; Mr. Smith must be so kind as not to mention it yet in his 
quarterly circulars.&nbsp; All human affairs are so uncertain, and my 
position especially is at present so peculiar, that I cannot count on the 
time, and would rather that no allusion should be made to a work of which 
great part is yet to create.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are two volumes in the first parcel which, having seen, I 
cannot bring myself to part with, and must beg Mr. Smith&rsquo;s permission
to retain: Mr. Thackeray&rsquo;s <i>Journey from Cornhill</i>, <i>etc</i>. 
and <i>The testimony to the Truth</i>.&nbsp; That last is indeed a book 
after my own heart.&nbsp; I <i>do</i> like the mind it discloses&mdash;it 
is of a fine and high order.&nbsp; Alexander Harris may be a clown by 
birth, but he is a nobleman by nature.&nbsp; When I could read no other 
book, I read his and derived comfort from it.&nbsp; No matter whether or 
not I can agree in all his views, it is the principles, the feelings, the 
heart of the man I admire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Write soon and tell me whether you think it advisable that I 
should send the MS.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. 
Bront&euml;</span>.&rsquo;</p>

<i>February</i> 4<i>th</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I send the parcel 
up without delay, according to your request.&nbsp; The manuscript has all 
its errors upon it, not <!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>having been read through since copying.&nbsp; 
I have kept <i>Madeline</i>, along with the two other books I mentioned; I 
shall consider it the gift of Miss Kavanagh, and shall value it both for 
its literary excellence and for the modest merit of the giver.&nbsp; We 
already possess Tennyson&rsquo;s <i>Poems</i> and <i>Our Street</i>.&nbsp; 
Emerson&rsquo;s <i>Essays</i> I read with much interest, and often with 
admiration, but they are of mixed gold and clay&mdash;deep and invigorating
truth, dreary and depressing fallacy seem to me combined therein.&nbsp; In 
George Borrow&rsquo;s works I found a wild fascination, a vivid graphic 
power of description, a fresh originality, an athletic simplicity (so to 
speak), which give them a stamp of their own.&nbsp; After reading his 
<i>Bible in Spain</i> I felt as if I had actually travelled at his side, 
and seen the &ldquo;wild Sil&rdquo; rush from its mountain cradle; wandered
in the hilly wilderness of the Sierras; encountered and conversed with 
Manehegan, Castillian, Andalusian, Arragonese, and, above all, with the 
savage Gitanos.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your mention of Mr. Taylor suggests to me that possibly you and 
Mr. Smith might wish him to share the little secret of the MS.&mdash;that 
exclusion might seem invidious, that it might make your mutual evening chat
less pleasant.&nbsp; If so, admit him to the confidence by all means.&nbsp;
He is attached to the firm, and will no doubt keep its secrets.&nbsp; I 
shall be glad of another censor, and if a severe one, so much the better, 
provided he is also just.&nbsp; I court the keenest criticism.&nbsp; Far 
rather would I never publish more, than publish anything inferior to my 
first effort.&nbsp; Be honest, therefore, all three of you.&nbsp; If you 
think this book promises less favourably than <i>Jane Eyre</i>, say so; it 
is but trying again, <i>i.e.</i>, if life and health be spared.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anne continues a little better&mdash;the mild weather suits 
her.&nbsp; At times I hear the renewal of hope&rsquo;s whisper, but I dare 
not listen too fondly; she deceived me cruelly before.&nbsp; A sudden 
change to cold would be the test.&nbsp; I dread such change, but must not 
anticipate.&nbsp; Spring lies before us, and then summer&mdash;surely we 
may hope a little!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anne expresses a wish to see the notices of the poems. You had 
better, therefore, send them.&nbsp; We shall expect to find painful 
allusions to one now above blame and beyond praise; but these <!-- page 
190--><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>must be 
borne.&nbsp; For ourselves, we are almost indifferent to censure.&nbsp; I 
read the <i>Quarterly</i> without a pang, except that I thought there were 
some sentences disgraceful to the critic.&nbsp; He seems anxious to let it 
be understood that he is a person well acquainted with the habits of the 
upper classes.&nbsp; Be this as it may, I am afraid he is no gentleman; and
moreover, that no training could make him such. <a

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;My sister still 
continues better: she has less languor and weakness; her spirits are 
improved.&nbsp; This change gives cause, I think, both for gratitude and 
hope.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad that you and Mr. Smith like the commencement of my 
present work.&nbsp; I wish it were <i>more than a commencement</i>; for how
it will be reunited after the long break, or how it can gather force of 
flow when the current has been checked or rather drawn off so long, I know 
not.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I sincerely thank you both for the candid expression of your 
objections.&nbsp; What you say with reference to the first chapter shall be
duly weighed.&nbsp; At present I feel reluctant to withdraw it, because, as
I formerly said of the Lowood part of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, <i>it is 
true</i>.&nbsp; The curates and their ongoings are merely photographed from
the life.&nbsp; I should like you to explain to me more fully the ground of
your objections.&nbsp; Is it because you think this chapter will render the
work liable to severe handling by the press?&nbsp; Is it because knowing as
you now do the identity of &ldquo;Currer Bell,&rdquo; this scene strikes 
you as unfeminine?&nbsp; Is it because it is intrinsically defective and 
inferior?&nbsp; I am afraid the two first reasons would not weigh with 
me&mdash;the last would.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anne and I thought it very kind in you to preserve all the 
notices of the Poems so carefully for us.&nbsp; Some of them, as you said, 
were well worth reading.&nbsp; We were glad to find that our old <!-- page 
191--><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>friend the 
<i>Critic</i> has again a kind word for us.&nbsp; I was struck with one 
curious fact, viz., that four of the notices are fac-similes of each 
other.&nbsp; How does this happen?&nbsp; I suppose they copy.&rsquo;</p>

regards the two last at least, any falling off; she is piteously 
thin.&nbsp; Her cough, and the pain in her side continue the same.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I write these few lines that you may not think my continued 
silence strange; anything like frequent correspondence I cannot keep up,

to say she is now again a little better.&nbsp; Her state of mind is usually
placid, and her chief sufferings consist in the harassing cough and a sense
of languor.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear L&aelig;titia</span>,&mdash;I have not 
quite forgotten you through the <!-- page 192--><a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>winter, but I have remembered you only like 
some pleasant waking idea struggling through a dreadful dream.&nbsp; You 
say my last letter was dated September 14th.&nbsp; You ask how I have 
passed the time since.&nbsp; What has happened to me?&nbsp; Why have I been
silent?</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is soon told.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the 24th of September my only brother, after being long in 
weak health, and latterly consumptive&mdash;though we were far from 
apprehending immediate danger&mdash;died, quite suddenly as it seemed to 
us.&nbsp; He had been out two days before.&nbsp; The shock was great.&nbsp;
Ere he could be interred I fell ill.&nbsp; A low nervous fever left me very
weak.&nbsp; As I was slowly recovering, my sister Emily, whom you knew, was
seized with inflammation of the lungs; suppuration took place; two 
agonising months of hopes and fears followed, and on the 19th of December 
<i>she died</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was scarcely cold in her grave when Anne, my youngest and 
last sister, who has been delicate all her life, exhibited symptoms that 
struck us with acute alarm.&nbsp; We sent for the first advice that could 
be procured.&nbsp; She was examined with the stethoscope, and the dreadful 
fact was announced that her lungs too were affected, and that tubercular 
consumption had already made considerable progress.&nbsp; A system of 
treatment was prescribed, which has since been ratified by the opinion of 
Dr. Forbes, whom your papa will, I dare say, know.&nbsp; I hope it has 
somewhat delayed disease.&nbsp; She is now a patient invalid, and I am her 
nurse.&nbsp; God has hitherto supported me in some sort through all these 
bitter calamities, and my father, I am thankful to say, has been 
wonderfully sustained; but there have been hours, days, weeks of 
inexpressible anguish to undergo, and the cloud of impending distress still
lowers dark and sullen above us.&nbsp; I cannot write much.&nbsp; I can 
only pray Providence to preserve you and yours from such affliction as He 
has seen good to accumulate on me and mine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Wooler</span>,&mdash;I have 
delayed answering your letter in the faint hope that I might be able to 
reply favourably to your inquiries after my sister&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; 
This, however, is not permitted me to do.&nbsp; Her decline is gradual and 
fluctuating, but its nature is not doubtful.&nbsp; The symptoms of cough, 
pain in the side and chest, wasting of flesh, strength, and appetite, after
the sad experience we have had, cannot but be regarded by us as 
equivocal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In spirit she is resigned; at heart she is, I believe, a true 
Christian.&nbsp; She looks beyond this life, and regards her home and rest 
as elsewhere than on earth.&nbsp; May God support her and all of us through
the trial of lingering sickness, and aid her in the last hour when the 
struggle which separates soul from body must be gone through!</p>
<p>&lsquo;We saw Emily torn from the midst of us when our hearts clung to 
her with intense attachment, and when, loving each other as we 
did&mdash;well, it seemed as if (might we but have been spared to each 
other) we could have found complete happiness in our mutual society and 
affection.&nbsp; She was scarcely buried when Anne&rsquo;s health failed, 
and we were warned that consumption had found another victim in her, and 
that it would be vain to reckon on her life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These things would be too much if Reason, unsupported by 
Religion, were condemned to bear them alone.&nbsp; I have cause to be most 
thankful for the strength which has hitherto been vouchsafed both to my 
father and myself.&nbsp; God, I think, is specially merciful to old age; 
and for my own part, trials which in prospective would have seemed to me 
quite intolerable, when they actually came, I endured without 
prostration.&nbsp; Yet, I must confess, that in the time which has elapsed 
since Emily&rsquo;s death, there have been moments of solitary, deep, inert
affliction, far harder to bear than those which immediately followed our 
loss.&nbsp; The crisis of bereavement has an acute pang which goads to 
exertion, the desolate after-feeling sometimes paralyses.</p>

strength: we must seek it in God&rsquo;s omnipotence.&nbsp; Fortitude is 
good, but fortitude itself must be shaken under us to teach us how weak we 
are.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With best wishes to yourself and all dear to you, and sincere

<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>April</i> 16<i>th</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your kind advice on
the subject of Hom&oelig;opathy deserves and has our best thanks.&nbsp; We 
find ourselves, however, urged from more than one quarter to try different 
systems and medicines, and I fear we have already given offence by not 
listening to all.&nbsp; The fact is, were we in every instance compliant, 
my dear sister would be harassed by continual changes.&nbsp; Cod-liver oil 
and carbonate of iron were first strongly recommended.&nbsp; Anne took them
as long as she could, but at last she was obliged to give them up: the oil 
yielded her no nutriment, it did not arrest the progress of emaciation, and
as it kept her always sick, she was prevented from taking food of any 
sort.&nbsp; Hydropathy was then strongly advised.&nbsp; She is now trying 
Gobold&rsquo;s Vegetable Balsam; she thinks it does her some good; and as 
it is the first medicine which has had that effect, she would wish to 
persevere with it for a time.&nbsp; She is also looking hopefully forward 
to deriving benefit from change of air.&nbsp; We have obtained Mr. 
Teale&rsquo;s permission to go to the seaside in the course of six or eight
weeks.&nbsp; At first I felt torn between two duties&mdash;that of staying 
with papa and going with Anne; but as it is papa&rsquo;s own most kindly 
expressed wish that I should adopt the latter plan, and as, besides, he is 
now, thank God! in tolerable health, I hope to be spared the pain of 
resigning the care of my sister to other hands, however friendly.&nbsp; We 
wish to keep together as long as we can.&nbsp; I hope, too, to derive from 
the change some renewal of physical strength and mental composure (in 
neither of which points am I what I ought or wish to be) to make me a 
better and more cheery nurse.</p>
<p><!-- page 195--><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
195</span>&lsquo;I fear I must have seemed to you hard in my observations 
about <i>The Emigrant Family</i>.&nbsp; The fact was, I compared Alexander 
Harris with himself only.&nbsp; It is not equal to the <i>Testimony to the 
Truth</i>, but, tried by the standard of other and very popular books too, 
it is very clever and original.&nbsp; Both subject and the manner of 
treating it are unhackneyed: he gives new views of new scenes and furnishes
interesting information on interesting topics.&nbsp; Considering the 
increasing necessity for and tendency to emigration, I should think it has 
a fair chance of securing the success it merits.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I took up Leigh Hunt&rsquo;s book <i>The Town</i> with the 
impression that it would be interesting only to Londoners, and I was 
surprised, ere I had read many pages, to find myself enchained by his 
pleasant, graceful, easy style, varied knowledge, just views, and kindly 
spirit.&nbsp; There is something peculiarly anti-melancholic in Leigh 
Hunt&rsquo;s writings, and yet they are never boisterous.&nbsp; They 
resemble sunshine, being at once bright and tranquil.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like Carlyle better and better.&nbsp; His style I do not like, 
nor do I always concur in his opinions, nor quite fall in with his hero 
worship; but there is a manly love of truth, an honest recognition and 
fearless vindication of intrinsic greatness, of intellectual and moral 
worth, considered apart from birth, rank, or wealth, which commands my 
sincere admiration.&nbsp; Carlyle would never do for a contributor to the 
<i>Quarterly</i>.&nbsp; I have not read his <i>French Revolution</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I congratulate you on the approaching publication of Mr. 
Ruskin&rsquo;s new work.&nbsp; If the <i>Seven Lamps of Architecture</i> 
resemble their predecessor, <i>Modern Painters</i>, they will be no lamps 
at all, but a new constellation&mdash;seven bright stars, for whose rising 
the reading world ought to be anxiously agaze.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not ask me to mention what books I should like to read.&nbsp; 
Half the pleasure of receiving a parcel from Cornhill consists in having 
its contents chosen for us.&nbsp; We like to discover, too, by the leaves 
cut here and there, that the ground has been travelled before us.&nbsp; I 
may however say, with reference to works of fiction, that I should much 
like to see one of Godwin&rsquo;s <!-- page 196--><a 
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>works, never having 
hitherto had that pleasure&mdash;<i>Caleb Williams</i> or <i>Fleetwood</i>,
or which you thought best worth reading.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is yet much too soon to talk of sending more books; our 
present stock is scarcely half exhausted.&nbsp; You will perhaps think I am
a slow reader, but remember, Currer Bell is a country housewife, and has 
sundry little matters connected with the needle and kitchen to attend to 
which take up half his day, especially now when, alas! there is but one 
pair of hands where once there were three.&nbsp; I did not mean to touch 
that chord, its sound is too sad.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I try to write now and then.&nbsp; The effort was a hard one at 
first.&nbsp; It renewed the terrible loss of last December strangely.&nbsp;
Worse than useless did it seem to attempt to write what there no longer 
lived an &ldquo;Ellis Bell&rdquo; to read; the whole book, with every hope 
founded on it, faded to vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One inducement to persevere and do my best I still have, however,
and I am thankful for it: I should like to please my kind friends at 
Cornhill.&nbsp; To that end I wish my powers would come back; and if it 
would please Providence to restore my remaining sister, I think they 
would.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not forget to tell me how you are when you write again.&nbsp; 
I trust your indisposition is quite gone by this time.&mdash;Believe me, 
yours sincerely,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>May</i> 1<i>st</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I returned Mary 
Taylor&rsquo;s letter to Hunsworth as soon as I had read it.&nbsp; Thank 
God she was safe up to that time, but I do not think the earthquake was 
then over.&nbsp; I shall long to hear tidings of her again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anne was worse during the warm weather we had about a week 
ago.&nbsp; She grew weaker, and both the pain in her side and her cough 
were worse; strange to say, since it is colder, she has appeared rather to 
revive than sink.&nbsp; I still hope that if she gets over May she may last
a long time.</p>
<p><!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
197</span>&lsquo;We have engaged lodgings at Scarbro&rsquo;.&nbsp; We 
stipulated for a good-sized sitting-room and an airy double-bedded lodging 
room, with a sea view, and if not deceived, have obtained these desiderata 
at No. 2 Cliff.&nbsp; Anne says it is one of the best situations in the 
place.&nbsp; It would not have done to have taken lodgings either in the 
town or on the bleak steep coast, where Miss Wooler&rsquo;s house is 
situated.&nbsp; If Anne is to get any good she must have every 
advantage.&nbsp; Miss Outhwaite [her godmother] left her in her will a 
legacy of &pound;200, and she cannot employ her money better than in 
obtaining what may prolong existence, if it does not restore health.&nbsp; 
We hope to leave home on the 23rd, and I think it will be advisable to rest
at York, and stay all night there.&nbsp; I hope this arrangement will suit 
you.&nbsp; We reckon on your society, dear Ellen, as a real privilege and 
pleasure.&nbsp; We shall take little luggage, and shall have to buy bonnets
and dresses and several other things either at York or Scarbro&rsquo;; 
which place do you think would be best?&nbsp; Oh, if it would please God to
strengthen and revive Anne, how happy we might be together!&nbsp; His will,
however, must be done, and if she is not to recover, it remains to pray for
strength and patience.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>May</i> 8<i>th</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I hasten to 
acknowledge the two kind letters for which I am indebted to you.&nbsp; That
fine spring weather of which you speak did not bring such happiness to us 
in its sunshine as I trust it did to you and thousands besides&mdash;the 
change proved trying to my sister.&nbsp; For a week or ten days I did not 
know what to think, she became so weak, and suffered so much from increased
pain in the side, and aggravated cough.&nbsp; The last few days have been 
much colder, yet, strange to say, during their continuance she has appeared
rather to revive than sink.&nbsp; She not unfrequently shows the very same 
symptoms which were apparent in Emily only a few days before she 
died&mdash;fever in the evenings, sleepless nights, and a sort of lethargy 
in the morning hours; this creates acute <!-- page 198--><a 
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>anxiety&mdash;then 
comes an improvement, which reassures.&nbsp; In about three weeks, should 
the weather be genial and her strength continue at all equal to the 
journey, we hope to go to Scarboro&rsquo;.&nbsp; It is not without 
misgiving that I contemplate a departure from home under such 
circumstances; but since she herself earnestly wishes the experiment to be 
tried, I think it ought not to be neglected.&nbsp; We are in God&rsquo;s 
hands, and must trust the results to Him.&nbsp; An old school-fellow of 
mine, a tried and faithful friend, has volunteered to accompany us.&nbsp; I
shall have the satisfaction of leaving papa to the attentions of two 
servants equally tried and faithful.&nbsp; One of them is indeed now old 
and infirm, and unfit to stir much from her chair by the kitchen fireside; 
but the other is young and active, and even she has lived with us seven 
years.&nbsp; I have reason, therefore, you see, to be thankful amidst 
sorrow, especially as papa still possesses every faculty unimpaired, and 
though not robust, has good general health&mdash;a sort of chronic cough is
his sole complaint.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope Mr. Smith will not risk a cheap edition of <i>Jane 
Eyre</i> yet, he had better wait awhile&mdash;the public will be sick of 
the name of that one book.&nbsp; I can make no promise as to when another 
will be ready&mdash;neither my time nor my efforts are my own.&nbsp; That 
absorption in my employment to which I gave myself up without fear of doing
wrong when I wrote <i>Jane Eyre</i>, would now be alike impossible and 
blamable; but I do what I can, and have made some little progress.&nbsp; We
must all be patient.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Meantime, I should say, let the public forget at their ease, and 
let us not be nervous about it.&nbsp; And as to the critics, if the Bells 
possess real merit, I do not fear impartial justice being rendered them one
day.&nbsp; I have a very short mental as well as physical sight in some 
matters, and am far less uneasy at the idea of public impatience, 
misconstruction, censure, etc., than I am at the thought of the anxiety of 
those two or three friends in Cornhill to whom I owe much kindness, and 
whose expectations I would earnestly wish not to disappoint.&nbsp; If they 
can make up their minds to wait tranquilly, <!-- page 199--><a 
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>and put some 
confidence in my goodwill, if not my power, to get on as well as may be, I 
shall not repine; but I verily believe that the &ldquo;nobler sex&rdquo; 
find it more difficult to wait, to plod, to work out their destiny inch by 
inch, than their sisters do.&nbsp; They are always for walking so fast and 
taking such long steps, one cannot keep up with them.&nbsp; One should 
never tell a gentleman that one has commenced a task till it is nearly 
achieved.&nbsp; Currer Bell, even if he had no let or hindrance, and if his
path were quite smooth, could never march with the tread of a Scott, a 
Bulwer, a Thackeray, or a Dickens.&nbsp; I want you and Mr. Smith clearly 
to understand this.&nbsp; I have always wished to guard you against 
exaggerated anticipations&mdash;calculate low when you calculate on 
me.&nbsp; An honest man&mdash;and woman too&mdash;would always rather rise 
above expectation than fall below it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have I lectured enough? and am I understood?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give my sympathising respects to Mrs. Williams. I hope her little
daughter is by this time restored to perfect health.&nbsp; It pleased me to
see with what satisfaction you speak of your son.&nbsp; I was glad, too, to
hear of the progress and welfare of Miss Kavanagh.&nbsp; The notices of Mr.
Harris&rsquo;s works are encouraging and just&mdash;may they contribute to 
his success!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Should Mr. Thackeray again ask after Currer Bell, say the secret 
is and will be well kept because it is not worth disclosure.&nbsp; This 
fact his own sagacity will have already led him to divine.&nbsp; In the 
hope that it may not be long ere I hear from you again,&mdash;Believe me, 
yours sincerely,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>May</i> 16<i>th</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Wooler</span>,&mdash;I will lose
no time in thanking you for your letter and kind offer of assistance.&nbsp;
We have, however, already engaged lodgings.&nbsp; I am not myself 
acquainted with Scarbro&rsquo;, but Anne knows it well, having been there 
three or four times.&nbsp; She had a particular preference for the 
situation of some lodgings (No. 2 Cliff).&nbsp; We wrote about them, and 
finding them disengaged, took them.&nbsp; <!-- page 200--><a 
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>Your information is, 
notwithstanding, valuable, should we find this place in any way 
ineligible.&nbsp; It is a satisfaction to be provided with directions for 
future use.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Next Wednesday is the day fixed for our departure.&nbsp; Ellen 
Nussey accompanies us (by Anne&rsquo;s expressed wish).&nbsp; I could not 
refuse her society, but I dared not urge her to go, for I have little hope 
that the excursion will be one of pleasure or benefit to those engaged in 
it.&nbsp; Anne is extremely weak.&nbsp; She herself has a fixed impression 
that the sea air will give her a chance of regaining strength; that chance,
therefore, we must have.&nbsp; Having resolved to try the experiment, 
misgivings are useless; and yet, when I look at her, misgivings will 
rise.&nbsp; She is more emaciated than Emily was at the very last; her 
breath scarcely serves her to mount the stairs, however slowly.&nbsp; She 
sleeps very little at night, and often passes most of the forenoon in a 
semi-lethargic state.&nbsp; Still, she is up all day, and even goes out a 
little when it is fine.&nbsp; Fresh air usually acts as a stimulus, but its
reviving power diminishes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With best wishes for your own health and welfare,&mdash;Believe 
me, my dear Miss Wooler, yours sincerely,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The date above will
inform you why I have not answered your last letter more promptly.&nbsp; I 
have been busy with preparations for departure and with the journey.&nbsp; 
I am thankful to say we reached our destination safely, having rested one 
night at York.&nbsp; We found assistance wherever we needed it; there was 
always an arm ready to do for my sister what I was not quite strong enough 
to do: lift her in and out of the carriages, carry her across the line, 
etc.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It made her happy to see both York and its Minster, and 
Scarboro&rsquo; and its bay once more.&nbsp; There is yet no revival of 
bodily strength&mdash;I fear indeed the slow ebb continues.&nbsp; People 
who see her tell me I must not expect her to last long&mdash;but it is 
something to cheer her mind.</p>
<p><!-- page 201--><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
201</span>&lsquo;Our lodgings are pleasant.&nbsp; As Anne sits at the 
window she can look down on the sea, which this morning is calm as 
glass.&nbsp; She says if she could breathe more freely she would be 
comfortable at this moment&mdash;but she cannot breathe freely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My friend Ellen is with us.&nbsp; I find her presence a 
solace.&nbsp; She is a calm, steady girl&mdash;not brilliant, but good and 
true.&nbsp; She suits and has always suited me well.&nbsp; I like her, with
her phlegm, repose, sense, and sincerity, better than I should like the 
most talented without these qualifications.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If ever I see you again I should have pleasure in talking over 
with you the topics you allude to in your last&mdash;or rather, in hearing 
<i>you</i> talk them over.&nbsp; We see these things through a glass 
darkly&mdash;or at least I see them thus.&nbsp; So far from objecting to 
speculation on, or discussion of, the subject, I should wish to hear what 
others have to say.&nbsp; By <i>others</i>, I mean only the serious and 
reflective&mdash;levity in such matters shocks as much as hypocrisy.</p>

more at present.&mdash;Believe me, yours sincerely,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am now again at 
home, where I returned last Thursday.&nbsp; I call it <i>home</i> 
still&mdash;much as London would be called London if an earthquake should 
shake its streets to ruins.&nbsp; But let me not be ungrateful: Haworth 
parsonage is still a home for me, and not quite a ruined or desolate home 
either.&nbsp; Papa is there, and two most affectionate and faithful <!-- 
page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
202</span>servants, and two old dogs, in their way as faithful and 
affectionate&mdash;Emily&rsquo;s large house-dog which lay at the side of 
her dying bed, and followed her funeral to the vault, lying in the pew 
couched at our feet while the burial service was being read&mdash;and 
Anne&rsquo;s little spaniel.&nbsp; The ecstasy of these poor animals when I
came in was something singular.&nbsp; At former returns from brief absences
they always welcomed me warmly&mdash;but not in that strange, 
heart-touching way.&nbsp; I am certain they thought that, as I was 
returned, my sisters were not far behind.&nbsp; But here my sisters will 
come no more.&nbsp; Keeper may visit Emily&rsquo;s little bed-room&mdash;as
he still does day by day&mdash;and Flossy may look wistfully round for 
Anne, they will never see them again&mdash;nor shall I&mdash;at least the 
human part of me.&nbsp; I must not write so sadly, but how can I help 
thinking and feeling sadly?&nbsp; In the daytime effort and occupation aid 
me, but when evening darkens, something in my heart revolts against the 
burden of solitude&mdash;the sense of loss and want grows almost too much 
for me.&nbsp; I am not good or amiable in such moments, I am rebellious, 
and it is only the thought of my dear father in the next room, or of the 
kind servants in the kitchen, or some caress from the poor dogs, which 
restores me to softer sentiments and more rational views.&nbsp; As to the 
night&mdash;could I do without bed, I would never seek it.&nbsp; Waking, I 
think, sleeping, I dream of them; and I cannot recall them as they were in 
health, still they appear to me in sickness and suffering.&nbsp; Still, my 
nights were worse after the first shock of Branwell&rsquo;s 
death&mdash;they were terrible then; and the impressions experienced on 
waking were at that time such as we do not put into language.&nbsp; Worse 
seemed at hand than was yet endured&mdash;in truth, worse awaited us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All this bitterness must be tasted.&nbsp; Perhaps the palate will
grow used to the draught in time, and find its flavour less acrid.&nbsp; 
This pain must be undergone; its poignancy, I trust, will be blunted one 
day.&nbsp; Ellen would have come back with me but I would not let 
her.&nbsp; I knew it would be better to face the desolation at 
once&mdash;later or sooner the sharp pang must be experienced.</p>
<p><!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
203</span>&lsquo;Labour must be the cure, not sympathy.&nbsp; Labour is the
only radical cure for rooted sorrow.&nbsp; The society of a calm, serenely 
cheerful companion&mdash;such as Ellen&mdash;soothes pain like a soft 
opiate, but I find it does not probe or heal the wound; sharper, more 
severe means, are necessary to make a remedy.&nbsp; Total change might do 
much; where that cannot be obtained, work is the best substitute.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I by no means ask Miss Kavanagh to write to me.&nbsp; Why should 
she trouble herself to do it?&nbsp; What claim have I on her?&nbsp; She 
does not know me&mdash;she cannot care for me except vaguely and on 
hearsay.&nbsp; I have got used to your friendly sympathy, and it comforts 
me.&nbsp; I have tried and trust the fidelity of one or two other friends, 
and I lean upon it.&nbsp; The natural affection of my father and the 
attachment and solicitude of our two servants are precious and consolatory 
to me, but I do not look round for general pity; conventional condolence I 
do not want, either from man or woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The letter you inclosed in your last bore the signature H. S. 
Mayers&mdash;the address, Sheepscombe, Stroud, Gloucestershire; can you 
give me any information respecting the writer?&nbsp; It is my intention to 
acknowledge it one day.&nbsp; I am truly glad to hear that your little 
invalid is restored to health, and that the rest of your family continue 
well.&nbsp; Mrs. Williams should spare herself for her husband&rsquo;s and 
children&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; Her life and health are too valuable to those 
round her to be lavished&mdash;she should be careful of them.&mdash;Believe
me, yours sincerely,</p>

204</span>CHAPTER VIII: ELLEN NUSSEY</h2>
<p>If to be known by one&rsquo;s friends is the index to character that it 
is frequently assumed to be, Charlotte Bront&euml; comes well out of that 
ordeal.&nbsp; She was discriminating in friendship and leal to the 
heart&rsquo;s core.&nbsp; With what gratitude she thought of the publisher 
who gave her the &lsquo;first chance&rsquo; we know by recognising that the
manly Dr. John of <i>Villette</i> was Mr. George Smith of Smith &amp; 
Elder.&nbsp; Mr. W. S. Williams, again, would seem to have been a 
singularly gifted and amiable man.&nbsp; To her three girl friends, Ellen 
Nussey, Mary Taylor, and L&aelig;titia Wheelwright, she was loyal to her 
dying day, and pencilled letters to the two of them who were in England 
were written in her last illness.&nbsp; Of all her friends, Ellen Nussey 
must always have the foremost place in our esteem.&nbsp; Like Mary Taylor, 
she made Charlotte&rsquo;s acquaintance when, at fifteen years of age, she 
first went to Roe Head School.&nbsp; Mrs. Gaskell has sufficiently 
described the beginnings of that friendship which death was not to 
break.&nbsp; Ellen Nussey and Charlotte Bront&euml; corresponded with a 
regularity which one imagines would be impossible had they both been born 
half a century later.&nbsp; The two girls loved one another 
profoundly.&nbsp; They wrote at times almost daily.&nbsp; They quarrelled 
occasionally over trifles, as friends will, but Charlotte was always full 
of contrition when a few hours had passed.&nbsp; Towards the end of her 
life she wrote to Mr. Williams a letter concerning Miss Nussey which may 
well be printed here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>January</i> 3<i>rd</i>, 1850.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have to 
acknowledge the receipt of the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> with a good review,
and of the <i>Church of England Quarterly</i> and the <i>Westminster</i> 
with bad ones.&nbsp; I have also to thank you for your letter, which would 
have been answered sooner had I been alone; but just now I am enjoying the 
treat of my friend Ellen&rsquo;s society, and she makes me indolent and 
negligent&mdash;I am too busy talking to her all day to do anything 
else.&nbsp; You allude to the subject of female friendships, and express 
wonder at the infrequency of sincere attachments amongst women.&nbsp; As to
married women, I can well understand that they should be absorbed in their 
husbands and children&mdash;but single women often like each other much, 
and derive great solace from their mutual regard.&nbsp; Friendship, 
however, is a plant which cannot be forced.&nbsp; True friendship is no 
gourd, springing in a night and withering in a day.&nbsp; When I first saw 
Ellen I did not care for her; we were school-fellows.&nbsp; In course of 
time we learnt each other&rsquo;s faults and good points.&nbsp; We were 
contrasts&mdash;still, we suited.&nbsp; Affection was first a germ, then a 
sapling, then a strong tree&mdash;now, no new friend, however lofty or 
profound in intellect&mdash;not even Miss Martineau herself&mdash;could be 
to me what Ellen is; yet she is no more than a conscientious, observant, 
calm, well-bred Yorkshire girl.&nbsp; She is without romance.&nbsp; If she 
attempts to read poetry, or poetic prose, aloud, I am irritated and deprive
her of the book&mdash;if she talks of it, I stop my ears; but she is good; 
she is true; she is faithful, and I love her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since I came home, Miss Martineau has written me a long and truly
kindly letter.&nbsp; She invites me to visit her at Ambleside.&nbsp; I like
the idea.&nbsp; Whether I can realise it or not, it is pleasant to have in 
prospect.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ask me to write to Mrs. Williams.&nbsp; I would rather she 
wrote to me first; and let her send any kind of letter she likes, without 
studying mood or manner.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. 
Bront&euml;</span>.&rsquo;</p>

<p><!-- page 206--><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
206</span>Good, True, Faithful&mdash;friendship has no sweeter words than 
these; and it was this loyalty in Miss Nussey which has marked her out in 
our day as a fine type of sweet womanliness, and will secure to her a 
lasting name as the friend of Charlotte Bront&euml;.</p>
<p>Miss Ellen Nussey was one of a large family of children, all of whom she
survives.&nbsp; Her home during the years of her first friendship with 
Charlotte Bront&euml; was at the Rydings, at that time the property of an 
uncle, Reuben Walker, a distinguished court physician.&nbsp; The family in 
that generation and in this has given many of its members to high public 
service in various professions.&nbsp; Two Nusseys, indeed, and two Walkers,
were court physicians in their day.&nbsp; When Earl Fitzwilliam was 
canvassing for the county in 1809, he was a guest at the Rydings for two 
weeks, and on his election was chaired by the tenantry.&nbsp; Reuben 
Walker, this uncle of Miss Nussey&rsquo;s, was the only Justice of the 
Peace for the district which included Leeds, Bradford, Huddersfield, and 
Halifax, during the Luddite riots&mdash;a significant reminder of the 
growth of population since that day.&nbsp; Ellen Nussey&rsquo;s home was at
the Rydings, then tenanted by her brother John, until 1837, and she then 
removed to Brookroyd, where she lived until long after Charlotte 
Bront&euml; died.</p>
<p>The first letter to Ellen Nussey is dated May 31, 1831, Charlotte having
become her school-fellow in the previous January.&nbsp; It would seem to 
have been a mere play exercise across the school-room, as the girls were 
then together at Roe Head.</p>

advantage of the earliest opportunity to thank you for the letter you 
favoured me with last week, and to apologise for having so long neglected 
to write to you; indeed, I believe this will be the first letter or note I 
have ever addressed to you.&nbsp; I am extremely obliged to Mary for her 
kind invitation, and I assure you that I should very much have liked to 
hear the Lectures on Galvanism, as they would doubtless have been amusing 
and instructive.&nbsp; But we are often compelled to bend our inclination 
to our duty (as Miss Wooler observed the other day), and since there are so
many holidays this half-year, it would have appeared almost unreasonable to
ask for an extra holiday; besides, we should perhaps have got behindhand 
with our lessons, so that, everything considered, it is perhaps as well 
that circumstances have deprived us of this pleasure.&mdash;Believe me to

<i>January</i> 13<i>th</i>, 1832.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;The receipt of your 
letter gave me an agreeable surprise, for notwithstanding your faithful 
promises, you must excuse me if I say that I had little confidence in their
fulfilment, knowing that when school girls once get home they willingly 
abandon every recollection which tends to remind them of school, and indeed
they find such an infinite variety of circumstances to engage their 
attention and employ their leisure hours, that they are easily persuaded 
that they have no time to fulfil promises made at school.&nbsp; It gave me 
great pleasure, however, to find that you and Miss Taylor are exceptions to
the general rule.&nbsp; The cholera still seems slowly advancing, but let 
us yet hope, knowing that all things are under the guidance of a merciful 
Providence.&nbsp; England has hitherto been highly favoured, for the 
disease has neither raged with the astounding violence, nor extended itself
with the frightful rapidity which marked its progress in many of the 
continental countries.&mdash;From your affectionate friend,</p>

<i>January</i> 1<i>st</i>, 1833.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I believe we agreed 
to correspond once a <!-- page 208--><a name="page208"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>month.&nbsp; That space of time has now 
elapsed since I received your last interesting letter, and I now therefore 
hasten to reply.&nbsp; Accept my congratulations on the arrival of the New 
Year, every succeeding day of which will, I trust, find you <i>wiser</i> 
and <i>better</i> in the true sense of those much-used words.&nbsp; The 
first day of January always presents to my mind a train of very solemn and 
important reflections, and a question more easily asked than answered 
frequently occurs, viz.&mdash;How have I improved the past year, and with 
what good intentions do I view the dawn of its successor?&nbsp; These, my 
dearest Ellen, are weighty considerations which (young as we are) neither 
you nor I can too deeply or too seriously ponder.&nbsp; I am sorry your too
great diffidence, arising, I think, from the want of sufficient confidence 
in your own capabilities, prevented you from writing to me in French, as I 
think the attempt would have materially contributed to your improvement in 
that language.&nbsp; You very kindly caution me against being tempted by 
the fondness of my sisters to consider myself of too much importance, and 
then in a parenthesis you beg me not to be offended.&nbsp; O Ellen, do you 
think I could be offended by any good advice you may give me?&nbsp; No, I 
thank you heartily, and love you, if possible, better for it.&nbsp; I am 
glad you like <i>Kenilworth</i>.&nbsp; It is certainly a splendid 
production, more resembling a romance than a novel, and, in my opinion, one
of the most interesting works that ever emanated from the great Sir 
Walter&rsquo;s pen.&nbsp; I was exceedingly amused at the characteristic 
and naive manner in which you expressed your detestation of Varney&rsquo;s 
character&mdash;so much so, indeed, that I could not forbear laughing aloud
when I perused that part of your letter.&nbsp; He is certainly the 
personification of consummate villainy; and in the delineation of his dark 
and profoundly artful mind, Scott exhibits a wonderful knowledge of human 
nature as well as surprising skill in embodying his perceptions so as to 
enable others to become participators in that knowledge.&nbsp; Excuse the 
want of news in this very barren epistle, for I really have none to 
communicate.&nbsp; Emily and Anne beg to be kindly remembered to you.&nbsp;
Give my best love to your mother and sisters, and as it is very late permit
me to conclude with the <!-- page 209--><a name="page209"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>assurance of my unchanged, unchanging, and 
unchangeable affection for you.&mdash;Adieu, my sweetest Ellen, I am ever 
yours,</p>

<p>Here is a pleasant testimony to Miss Nussey&rsquo;s attractions from

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I have hitherto 
delayed answering your last letter because from what you said I imagined 
you might be from home.&nbsp; Since you were here Emily has been very 
ill.&nbsp; Her ailment was erysipelas in the arm, accompanied by severe 
bilious attacks, and great general debility.&nbsp; Her arm was obliged to 
be cut in order to relieve it.&nbsp; It is now, I am happy to say, nearly 
healed&mdash;her health is, in fact, almost perfectly re-established.&nbsp;
The sickness still continues to recur at intervals.&nbsp; Were I to tell 
you of the impression you have made on every one here you would accuse me 
of flattery.&nbsp; Papa and aunt are continually adducing you as an example
for me to shape my actions and behaviour by.&nbsp; Emily and Anne say 
&ldquo;they never saw any one they liked so well as Miss Nussey,&rdquo; and
Tabby talks a great deal more nonsense about you than I choose to 
report.&nbsp; You must read this letter, dear Ellen, without thinking of 
the writing, for I have indited it almost all in the twilight.&nbsp; It is 
now so dark that, notwithstanding the singular property of &ldquo;seeing in
the night-time&rdquo; which the young ladies at Roe Head used to attribute 
to me, I can scribble no longer.&nbsp; All the family unite with me in 
wishes for your welfare.&nbsp; Remember me respectfully to your mother and 
sisters, and supply all those expressions of warm and genuine regard which 
the increasing darkness will not permit me to insert.</p>

<i>February</i> 11<i>th</i>, 1834.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;My letters are 
scarcely worth the postage, and therefore I have, till now, delayed 
answering your last communication; but upwards of two months having elapsed
<!-- page 210--><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
210</span>since I received it, I have at length determined to take up my 
pen in reply lest your anger should be roused by my apparent 
negligence.&nbsp; It grieved me extremely to hear of your precarious state 
of health.&nbsp; I trust sincerely that your medical adviser is mistaken in
supposing you have any tendency to a pulmonary affection.&nbsp; Dear Ellen,
that would indeed be a calamity.&nbsp; I have seen enough of consumption to
dread it as one of the most insidious and fatal diseases incident to 
humanity.&nbsp; But I repeat it, I <i>hope</i>, nay <i>pray</i>, that your 
alarm is groundless.&nbsp; If you remember, I used frequently to tell you 
at school that you were constitutionally nervous&mdash;guard against the 
gloomy impressions which such a state of mind naturally produces.&nbsp; 
Take constant and regular exercise, and all, I doubt not, will yet be 
well.&nbsp; What a remarkable winter we have had!&nbsp; Rain and wind 
continually, but an almost total absence of frost and snow.&nbsp; Has 
<i>general</i> ill health been the consequence of wet weather at Birstall 
or not?&nbsp; With us an unusual number of deaths have lately taken 
place.&nbsp; According to custom I have no news to communicate, indeed I do
not write either to retail gossip or to impart solid information; my 
motives for maintaining our mutual correspondence are, in the first place, 
to get intelligence from you, and in the second that we may remind each 
other of our separate existences; without some such medium of reciprocal 
converse, according to the nature of things, <i>you</i>, who are surrounded
by society and friends, would soon forget that such an insignificant being 
as myself ever lived.&nbsp; <i>I</i>, however, in the solitude of our wild 
little hill village, think of my only unrelated friend, my dear ci-devant 
school companion daily&mdash;nay, almost hourly.&nbsp; Now Ellen, 
don&rsquo;t you think I have very cleverly contrived to make up a letter 
out of nothing?&nbsp; Goodbye, dearest.&nbsp; That God may bless you is the
earnest prayer of your ever faithful friend,</p>

<i>November</i> 10<i>th</i>, 1834.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I have been a long 
while, a very long while without writing to you.&nbsp; A letter I received 
from Mary Taylor <!-- page 211--><a name="page211"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>this morning reminded me of my neglect, and 
made me instantly sit down to atone for it, if possible.&nbsp; She tells me
your aunt, of Brookroyd, is dead, and that Sarah is very ill; for this I am
truly sorry, but I hope her case is not yet without hope.&nbsp; You should 
however remember that death, should it happen, will undoubtedly be great 
gain to her.&nbsp; In your last, dear Ellen, you ask my opinion respecting 
the amusement of dancing, and whether I thought it objectionable when 
indulged in for an hour or two in parties of boys and girls.&nbsp; I should
hesitate to express a difference of opinion from Mr. Atkinson, but really 
the matter seems to me to stand thus: It is allowed on all hands that the 
sin of dancing consists not in the mere action of shaking the shanks (as 
the Scotch say), but in the consequences that usually attend 
it&mdash;namely, frivolity and waste of time; when it is used only, as in 
the case you state, for the exercise and amusement of an hour among young 
people (who surely may without any breach of God&rsquo;s commandments be 
allowed a little light-heartedness), these consequences cannot 
follow.&nbsp; Ergo (according to my manner of arguing), the amusement is at
such times perfectly innocent.&nbsp; Having nothing more to say, I will 
conclude with the expression of my sincere and earnest attachment for, 
Ellen, your own dear self.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dearest Ellen</span>,&mdash;I thought it 
better not to answer your kind letter too soon, lest I should (in the 
present fully occupied state of your time) appear intrusive.&nbsp; I am 
happy to inform you papa has given me permission to accept the invitation 
it conveyed, and ere long I hope once more to have the pleasure of seeing 
<i>almost</i> the <i>only</i> and certainly the <i>dearest</i> friend I 
possess (out of our own family).&nbsp; I leave it to you to fix the time, 
only requesting you not to appoint too early a day; let it be a fortnight 
or three weeks at least from the date of the present letter.&nbsp; I am 
greatly obliged to you for your kind offer of meeting me at Bradford, but 
papa thinks that such a plan <!-- page 212--><a name="page212"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>would involve uncertainty, and be productive 
of trouble to you.&nbsp; He recommends that I should go direct in a gig 
from Haworth at the time you shall determine, or, if that day should prove 
unfavourable, the first subsequent fine one.&nbsp; Such an arrangement 
would leave us both free, and if it meets with your approbation would 
perhaps be the best we could finally resolve upon.&nbsp; Excuse the brevity
of this epistle, dear Ellen, for I am in a great hurry, and we shall, I 
trust, soon see each other face to face, which will be better than a 
hundred letters.&nbsp; Give my respectful love to your mother and sisters, 
accept the kind remembrances of all our family, and&mdash;Believe me in 
particular to be, your firm and faithful friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Charlotte 
Bront&euml;</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;You ask me to stay a month when I come, but as 
I do not wish to tire you with my company, and as, besides, papa and aunt 
both think a fortnight amply sufficient, I shall not exceed that 
period.&nbsp; Farewell, <i>dearest</i>, <i>dearest</i>.&rsquo;</p>

how to refuse, and it is still more embarrassing to accept.&nbsp; At any 
rate, I cannot come this week, for we are in the very thickest 
<i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> of the repetitions; I was hearing the terrible 
fifth section when your note arrived.&nbsp; But Miss Wooler says I must go 
to Gomersall next Friday as she promised for me on Whitsunday; and on 
Sunday morning I will join you at church, if it be convenient, and stay at 
Rydings till Monday morning.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a free and easy 
proposal!&nbsp; Miss Wooler has driven me to it&mdash;she says her 
character is implicated!&nbsp; I am very sorry to hear that your mother has
been ill.&nbsp; I do hope she is better now, and that all the rest of the 
family are well.&nbsp; Will you be so kind as to deliver the accompanying 
note to Miss Taylor when you see her at church on Sunday?&nbsp; Dear Ellen,
excuse the most horrid scrawl ever penned by mortal hands.&nbsp; Remember 
me to your mother and sisters, and&mdash;Believe me, E. Nussey&rsquo;s

<p>&lsquo;I read your letter with dismay, Ellen&mdash;what shall I do 
without you?&nbsp; Why are we so to be denied each other&rsquo;s 
society?&nbsp; It is an inscrutable fatality.&nbsp; I long to be with you 
because it seems as if two or three days or weeks spent in your company 
would beyond measure strengthen me in the enjoyment of those feelings which
I have so lately begun to cherish.&nbsp; You first pointed out to me that 
way in which I am so feebly endeavouring to travel, and now I cannot keep 
you by my side, I must proceed sorrowfully alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why are we to be divided?&nbsp; Surely, Ellen, it must be because
we are in danger of loving each other too well&mdash;of losing sight of the
<i>Creator</i> in idolatry of the <i>creature</i>.&nbsp; At first I could 
not say, &ldquo;Thy will be done.&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt rebellious; but I 
know it was wrong to feel so.&nbsp; Being left a moment alone this morning 
I prayed fervently to be enabled to resign myself to <i>every</i> decree of
God&rsquo;s will&mdash;though it should be dealt forth with a far severer 
hand than the present disappointment.&nbsp; Since then, I have felt calmer 
and humbler&mdash;and consequently happier.&nbsp; Last Sunday I took up my 
Bible in a gloomy frame of mind; I began to read; a feeling stole over me 
such as I have not known for many long years&mdash;a sweet placid sensation
like those that I remember used to visit me when I was a little child, and 
on Sunday evenings in summer stood by the open window reading the life of a
certain French nobleman who attained a purer and higher degree of sanctity 
than has been known since the days of the early Martyrs.&nbsp; I thought of
my own Ellen&mdash;I wished she had been near me that I might have told her
how happy I was, how bright and glorious the pages of God&rsquo;s holy word
seemed to me.&nbsp; But the &ldquo;foretaste&rdquo; passed away, and earth 
and sin returned.&nbsp; I must see you before you go, Ellen; if you cannot 
come to Roe Head I will contrive to walk over to Brookroyd, provided you 
will let me know the time of your departure.&nbsp; Should you not be at 
home at Easter I dare not promise to accept your mother&rsquo;s and 
sisters&rsquo; invitation.&nbsp; <!-- page 214--><a 
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>I should be miserable
at Brookroyd without you, yet I would contrive to visit them for a few 
hours if I could not for a few days.&nbsp; I love them for your sake.&nbsp;
I have written this note at a venture.&nbsp; When it will reach you I know 
not, but I was determined not to let slip an opportunity for want of being 
prepared to embrace it.&nbsp; Farewell, may God bestow on you all His 
blessings.&nbsp; My darling&mdash;Farewell.&nbsp; Perhaps you may return 
before midsummer&mdash;do you think you possibly can?&nbsp; I wish your

and it was from them I obtained the information.&nbsp; This morning I set 
off to Brookroyd to learn further particulars, from whence I am but just 
returned.&nbsp; Your mother is in great distress about you, she can hardly 
mention your name without tears; and both she and Mercy wish very much to 
see you at home again.&nbsp; Poor girl, you have been a fortnight confined 
to your bed; and while I was blaming you in my own mind for not writing, 
you were suffering in sickness without one kind <i>female</i> friend to 
watch over you.&nbsp; I should have heard all this before and have hastened
to express my sympathy with you in this crisis had I been able to visit 
Brookroyd in the Easter holidays, but an unexpected summons back to 
Dewsbury Moor, in consequence of the illness and death of Mr. Wooler, 
prevented it.&nbsp; Since that time I have been a fortnight and two days 
quite alone, Miss Wooler being detained in the interim at Rouse Mill.&nbsp;
You <!-- page 216--><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

to me just two lines&mdash;just to assure me of your convalescence; not a 
word, however, if it would harm you&mdash;not a syllable.&nbsp; They value 
you at home.&nbsp; Sickness and absence call forth expressions of 
attachment which might have remained long enough unspoken if their object 
had been present and well.&nbsp; I wish your <i>friends</i> (I include 
myself in that word) may soon cease to have cause for so painful an 
excitement of their regard.&nbsp; As yet I have but an imperfect idea of 
the nature of your illness&mdash;of its extent&mdash;or of the degree in 
which it may now have subsided.&nbsp; When you can let me know all, no 
particular, however minute, will be uninteresting to me.&nbsp; How have 
your spirits been?&nbsp; I trust not much overclouded, for that is the most
melancholy result of illness.&nbsp; You are not, I understand, going to 
Bath at present; they seem to have arranged matters strangely.&nbsp; When I
parted from you near White-lee Bar, I had a more sorrowful feeling than 
ever I experienced before in our temporary separations.&nbsp; It is foolish
to dwell too much on the idea of presentiments, but I certainly had a 
feeling that the time of our reunion had never been so indefinite or so 
distant as then.&nbsp; I doubt not, my dear Ellen, that amidst your many 
trials, amidst the sufferings that you have of late felt in yourself, and 
seen in several of your relations, you have still been able to look up and 
find support in trial, consolation in affliction, and repose in tumult, 
where human interference can make no change.&nbsp; I think you know in the 
right spirit how to withdraw yourself from the vexation, the care, the 
meanness of life, and to derive comfort from purer sources than this world 
can afford.&nbsp; You know how to do it silently, unknown to others, and 
can avail yourself of that hallowed communion the Bible gives us with 
God.&nbsp; I am charged to transmit your mother&rsquo;s and sister&rsquo;s 
love.&nbsp; Receive mine in the same parcel, I think it will scarcely be 
the smallest share.&nbsp; Farewell, my dear Ellen.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I read your last 
letter with a great deal of interest.&nbsp; Perhaps it is not always well 
to tell people when we approve of their actions, and yet it is very 
pleasant to do so; and as, if you had done wrongly, I hope I should have 
had honesty enough to tell you so, so now, as you have done rightly, I

<p>&lsquo;If I made you my father confessor I could reveal weaknesses which
you do not dream of.&nbsp; I do not mean to intimate that I attach a

made me feel a sense of confused pleasure which it required my strongest 
effort to conceal&mdash;and on the other hand, a hasty expression which I 
could construe into neglect or disapprobation has tortured me till I have 
lost half a night&rsquo;s rest from its rankling pangs.</p>

<p>Here is the only glimpse that we find of her Penzance relatives in these
later years.&nbsp; They would seem to have visited Haworth when Charlotte 
was twenty-four years of age.&nbsp; The impression they left was not a 
kindly one.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;As you only sent 
me a note, I shall only send you one, and that not out of revenge, but 
because like you I have but little to say.&nbsp; The freshest news in our 
house is that we had, a fortnight ago, a visit from some of our South of 
England relations, John Branwell and his wife and daughter.&nbsp; They have
been staying above a month with Uncle Fennell at Crosstone.&nbsp; They 
reckon to be very grand folks indeed, and <!-- page 218--><a 
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>talk largely&mdash;I 
thought assumingly.&nbsp; I cannot say I much admired them.&nbsp; To my 
eyes there seemed to be an attempt to play the great Mogul down in 
Yorkshire.&nbsp; Mr. Branwell was much less assuming than the womenites; he
seemed a frank, sagacious kind of man, very tall and vigorous, with a keen 
active look.&nbsp; The moment he saw me he exclaimed that I was the very 
image of my aunt Charlotte.&nbsp; Mrs. Branwell sets up for being a woman 
of great talent, tact, and accomplishment.&nbsp; I thought there was much 
more noise than work.&nbsp; My cousin Eliza is a young lady intended by 
nature to be a bouncing, good-looking girl&mdash;art has trained her to be 
a languishing, affected piece of goods.&nbsp; I would have been friendly 
with her, but I could get no talk except about the Low Church, Evangelical 
clergy, the Millennium, Baptist Noel, botany, and her own conversion.&nbsp;
A mistaken education has utterly spoiled the lass.&nbsp; Her face tells 
that she is naturally good-natured, though perhaps indolent.&nbsp; Her 
affectations were so utterly out of keeping with her round rosy face and 
tall bouncing figure, I could hardly refrain from laughing as I watched 
her.&nbsp; Write a long letter next time and I&rsquo;ll write you 
ditto.&nbsp; Good-bye.&rsquo;</p>

<p>We have already read the letters which were written to Miss Nussey 
during the governess period, and from Brussels.&nbsp; On her final return 
from Brussels, Charlotte implores a letter.</p>

expect to hear.&nbsp; I want, however, further enlightenment on the 
subject.&nbsp; Can you tell me what has caused the change in Mary&rsquo;s 
plans, and brought her so suddenly back to England?&nbsp; Is it on account 
of Mary Dixon?&nbsp; Is it the wish of her brother, or is it her own 
determination?&nbsp; I hope, whatever the reason be, it is nothing which 
can give her uneasiness or do her harm.&nbsp; Do you know how long she is 
likely to stay in England? or when she arrives at Hunsworth?</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ask how I am.&nbsp; I really have felt much better the last

something of a headache, and was consequently rather out of spirits, and 
the epistle (scarcely legible though it be&mdash;excuse a rub) cheered 
me.&nbsp; In order to evince my gratitude, as well as to please my own 
inclination, I sit down to answer it immediately.&nbsp; I am glad, in the

more so to learn that his wife-elect has a handsome fortune&mdash;not that 
I advocate marrying for money in general, but I think in many cases (and 
this is one) money is a very desirable contingent of matrimony.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wonder when Mary Taylor is expected in England.&nbsp; I trust 
you will be at home while she is at Hunsworth, and that you, she, and I, 
may meet again somewhere under the canopy of heaven.&nbsp; I cannot, dear 
Ellen, make any promise about myself and Anne going to Brookroyd at 
Christmas; her vacations are so short she would grudge spending any part of
them from home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The catastrophe, which you related so calmly, about your 
book-muslin dress, lace bertha, etc., convulsed me with cold shudderings of
horror.&nbsp; You have reason to curse the day when so fatal a present was 
offered you as that infamous little &ldquo;varmint.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
perfect serenity with which you endured the disaster proves most fully to 
me that you would make the best wife, mother, and mistress in the 
world.&nbsp; You and Anne are a pair for marvellous philosophical powers of
endurance; no spoilt dinners, scorched linen, dirtied carpets, torn 
sofa-covers, squealing brats, cross husbands, would ever discompose either 
of you.&nbsp; You ought never to marry a good-tempered man, it would be 
mingling honey with sugar, like sticking white roses upon a black-thorn 
cudgel.&nbsp; With this very picturesque metaphor I close my letter.&nbsp;

<p>Much has been said concerning Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s visit to 
Hathersage in Derbyshire, and it is interesting because of the <!-- page 
221--><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>fact that 
Miss Bront&euml; obtained the name of &lsquo;Eyre&rsquo; from a family in 
that neighbourhood, and Morton in <i>Jane Eyre</i> may obviously be 
identified with Hathersage. <a name="citation221"></a><a 
href="#footnote221" class="citation">[221]</a>&nbsp; Miss Ellen 
Nussey&rsquo;s brother Henry became Vicar of Hathersage, and he married 
shortly afterwards.&nbsp; While he was on his honeymoon his sister went to 
Hathersage to keep house for him, and she invited her friend Charlotte 
Bront&euml; to stay with her.&nbsp; The visit lasted three weeks.&nbsp; 
This was the only occasion that Charlotte visited Hathersage.&nbsp; Here 
are two or three short notes referring to that visit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>June</i> 10<i>th</i>, 1845.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;It is very vexatious
for you to have had to go to Sheffield in vain.&nbsp; I am glad to hear 
that there is an omnibus on Thursday, and I have told Emily and Anne I will
try to come on that day.&nbsp; The opening of the railroad is now postponed
till July 7th.&nbsp; I should not like to put you off again, and for that 
and some other reasons they have decided to give up the idea of going to 
Scarbro&rsquo;, and instead, to make a little excursion next Monday and 
Tuesday, to Ilkley or elsewhere.&nbsp; I hope no other obstacle will arise 
to prevent my going to Hathersage.&nbsp; I do long to be with you, and I 
feel nervously afraid of being prevented, or put off in some way.&nbsp; 
Branwell only stayed a week with us, but he is to come home again when the 
family go to Scarboro&rsquo;.&nbsp; I will write to Brookroyd 
directly.&nbsp; Yesterday I had a little note from Henry inviting me to go 
to see you.&nbsp; This is one of your contrivances, for which you deserve 
smothering.&nbsp; You have written to Henry to tell him to write to 
me.&nbsp; Do you think I stood on ceremony about the matter?</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Nussey</span>,&mdash;I lose no 
time after my return home in writing to you and offering you my sincere 
thanks for the kindness with which you have repeatedly invited me to go and
stay a few days at Brookroyd.&nbsp; It would have given me great pleasure 
to have gone, had it been only for a day, just to have seen you and Miss 
Mercy (Miss Nussey I suppose is not at home) and to have been introduced to
Mrs. Henry, but I have stayed so long with Ellen at Hathersage that I could
not possibly now go to Brookroyd.&nbsp; I was expected at home; and after 
all <i>home</i> should always have the first claim on our attention.&nbsp; 
When I reached home (at ten o&rsquo;clock on Saturday night) I found papa, 
I am thankful to say, pretty well, but he thought I had been a long time 
away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I left Ellen well, and she had generally good health while I 
stayed with her, but she is very anxious about matters of business, and 
apprehensive lest things should not be comfortable against the arrival of 
Mr. and Mrs. Henry&mdash;she is so desirous that the day of their arrival 
at Hathersage should be a happy one to both.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope, my dear Mrs. Nussey, you are well; and I should be very 
happy to receive a little note either from you or from Miss Mercy to assure
me of this.&mdash;Believe me, yours affectionately and sincerely,</p>

staying with you at Hathersage.&nbsp; It was not then obtrusive, and 
perhaps might never become so.&nbsp; Your good sense, firm principle, and

Haworth.&nbsp; Do you scold me out of habit, or are you really angry?&nbsp;
In either case it is all nonsense.&nbsp; You know as well as I do that to 
go to Brookroyd is always a pleasure to me, and that to one who has so 
little change, and so few friends as I have, it must be a <i>great

take my pleasure.&nbsp; I wish so much to see you, that I shall certainly

harmed you or yours much.&nbsp; It has nipped me severely, taken away my 
appetite for a while and given me toothache; in short, put me in the ailing
condition, in which I have more than once had the honour of making myself 
such a nuisance both at Brookroyd and Hunsworth.&nbsp; The consequence is 
that at this present speaking I look almost old enough to be your

will not peck it out of the envelope at the Bradford Post-office, where 
they generally take the liberty of opening letters when they feel soft as

give her a temporary asylum, and a relief from uneasiness, suffering, and 
gloom.&nbsp; What you say about the effects of ether on your sister rather 
startled me.&nbsp; I had always consoled myself with the idea of having 
some teeth extracted some day under its soothing influence, but now I 
should think twice before I consented to inhale it; one would not like to 
make a fool of one&rsquo;s self.&mdash;I am, yours faithfully,</p>

sense, for what are beauty, wealth, or even health without it?&nbsp; I had 
a note from Miss Ringrose the other day.&nbsp; I do not think I shall write
again, for the reasons I before mentioned to you; but the note moved me 
much, it was almost all about her dear Ellen, a kind of gentle enthusiasm

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I have just received
your little parcel, and beg to thank you in all our names for its contents,
and also for your letter, of the arrival of which I was, to speak truth, 
getting rather impatient.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The housewife&rsquo;s travelling companion is a most commodious

which yet I should never have the courage or industry to sit down and make 
for myself.&nbsp; I shall keep it for occasions of going from home, it will
save me a world of trouble.&nbsp; It must have required some thought to 
arrange the various compartments and their contents so aptly.&nbsp; I had 
quite forgotten till your letter reminded me that it was the anniversary of
your birthday and mine.&nbsp; I am now thirty-two.&nbsp; Youth is 
gone&mdash;gone&mdash;and will never come back; can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; 
I wish you many returns of your birthday and increase of happiness with 
increase of years.&nbsp; It seems to me that sorrow must come sometime to 
every body, and those who scarcely taste it in their youth often have a 
more brimming and bitter cup to drain in after-life; whereas, those who 
exhaust the dregs early, who drink the lees before the wine, may reasonably
expect a purer and more palatable draught to succeed.&nbsp; So, at least, 
one fain would hope.&nbsp; It touched me at first a little painfully to 
hear of your purposed governessing, but on second thoughts I discovered 
this to be quite a foolish feeling.&nbsp; You are doing right even though 
you should not gain much.&nbsp; The effort will do you good; no one ever 
does regret a step towards self-help; it is so much gained in 
independence.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dear Ellen,&mdash;I shall begin by telling you that you have no 
right to be angry at the length of time I have suffered to slip by since 
receiving your last, without answering it, because you have often kept me 
waiting much longer; and having made this gracious speech, thereby 
obviating reproaches, I will add that I think it a great shame when you 
receive a long and thoroughly interesting letter, full of the sort of 
details you fully relish, to read the same with selfish pleasure and not 
even have the manners to thank your correspondent, and express how much you
enjoyed the narrative.&nbsp; I <i>did</i> enjoy the narrative in your last 
very keenly; the exquisitely characteristic traits <!-- page 229--><a

were worth gold; just like not only them but all their 
class&mdash;respectable, well-meaning people enough, but with all that 
petty assumption of dignity, that small jealousy of senseless formalities, 
which to such people seems to form a second religion.&nbsp; Your position 
amongst them was detestable.&nbsp; I admire the philosophy with which you 
bore it.&nbsp; Their taking offence because you stayed all night at their 
aunt&rsquo;s is rich.&nbsp; It is right not to think much of casual 
attentions; it is quite justifiable also to derive from them temporary 
gratification, insomuch as they prove that their object has the power of 
pleasing.&nbsp; Let them be as ephemera&mdash;to last an hour, and not be 
regretted when gone.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I should not have 
written to you to-day by choice.&nbsp; Lately I have again been harassed 
with headache&mdash;the heavy electric atmosphere oppresses me much, yet I 
am less miserable just now than I was a little while ago.&nbsp; A severe 
shock came upon me about papa.&nbsp; He was suddenly attacked with acute 
inflammation of the eye.&nbsp; Mr. Ruddock was sent for; and after he had 
examined him, he called me into another room, and said papa&rsquo;s pulse 
was bounding at 150 per minute, that there was a strong pressure of blood 
upon the brain, that, in short, the symptoms were decidedly apoplectic.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Active measures were immediately taken.&nbsp; By the next day the
pulse was reduced to ninety.&nbsp; Thank God he is now better, though not 
well.&nbsp; The eye is a good deal inflamed.&nbsp; He does not know his 
state.&nbsp; To tell him he had been in danger of apoplexy would almost be 
to kill him at once&mdash;it would increase the rush to the brain and 
perhaps bring about rupture.&nbsp; He is kept very quiet.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I write a line to 
say that papa is now considered out of danger.&nbsp; His progress to health
is not without relapse, but I think he gains ground, if slowly, 
surely.&nbsp; Mr. Ruddock says the seizure was quite of an apoplectic 
character; there was a partial paralysis for two days, but the mind 
remained clear, in spite of a high degree of nervous irritation.&nbsp; One 
eye still remains inflamed, and papa is weak, but all muscular affection is
gone, and the pulse is accurate.&nbsp; One cannot be too thankful that

his spirits sunk painfully.&nbsp; Tuesday and yesterday, however, were much

spirits which accompanies anything like a relapse is almost the most 
difficult point to manage.&nbsp; Dear Nell, you are tenderly kind in 
offering your society; but rest very tranquil where you are; be fully 
assured that it is not now, nor under present circumstances, that I feel 
the lack either of society or occupation; my time is pretty well filled up,

obviated.&nbsp; I cannot permit myself to comment much on the chief

<p>To Miss Nussey we owe many other letters than those here 
printed&mdash;indeed, they must needs play an important part in Charlotte 
Bront&euml;&rsquo;s biography.&nbsp; They do not deal with the intellectual
interests which are so marked in the letters to W. S. Williams, and which, 
doubtless, characterised the letters to Miss Mary Taylor.&nbsp; &lsquo;I 
ought to have written this letter to Mary,&rsquo; Charlotte says, when on 
one occasion <!-- page 233--><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>she dropped into literature to her friend; but the friendship was
as precious as most intellectual friendships, because it was based upon a 
common esteem and an unselfish devotion.&nbsp; Ellen Nussey, as we have 
seen, accompanied Anne Bront&euml; to Scarborough, and was at her 
death-bed.&nbsp; She attended Charlotte&rsquo;s wedding, and lived to mourn
over her tomb.&nbsp; For forty years she has been the untiring advocate and
staunch champion, hating to hear a word in her great friend&rsquo;s 
dispraise, loving to note the glorious recognition, of which there has been
so rich and so full a harvest.&nbsp; That she still lives to receive our 
reverent gratitude for preserving so many interesting traits of the 
Bront&euml;s, is matter for full and cordial congratulation, wherever the 
names of the authors of <i>Jane Eyre</i> and <i>Wuthering Heights</i> are 
held in just and wise esteem.</p>
<h2><!-- page 234--><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
234</span>CHAPTER IX: MARY TAYLOR</h2>
<p>Mary Taylor, the &lsquo;M---&rsquo; of Mrs. Gaskell&rsquo;s biography, 
and the &lsquo;Rose Yorke&rsquo; of <i>Shirley</i>, will always have a 
peculiar interest to those who care for the Bront&euml;s.&nbsp; She shrank 
from publicity, and her name has been less mentioned than that of any other
member of the circle.&nbsp; And yet hers was a personality singularly 
strenuous and strong.&nbsp; She wrote two books &lsquo;with a 
purpose,&rsquo; and, as we shall see, vigorously embodied her teaching in 
her life.&nbsp; It will be remembered that Charlotte Bront&euml;, Ellen 
Nussey, and Mary Taylor first met at Roe Head School, when Charlotte and 
Mary were fifteen and her friend about fourteen years of age.&nbsp; Here 
are Miss Nussey&rsquo;s impressions&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;She was pretty, and very childish-looking, dressed in a 
red-coloured frock with short sleeves and low neck, as then worn by young 
girls.&nbsp; Miss Wooler in later years used to say that when Mary went to 
her as a pupil she thought her too pretty to live.&nbsp; She was not 
talkative at school, but industrious, and always ready with lessons.&nbsp; 
She was always at the top in class lessons, with Charlotte Bront&euml; and 
the writer; seldom a change was made, and then only with the 
three&mdash;one move.&nbsp; Charlotte and she were great friends for a 
time, but there was no withdrawing from me on either side, and Charlotte 
never quite knew how an estrangement arose with Mary, but it lasted a long 
time.&nbsp; Then a time came that both Charlotte and Mary were so 
proficient in schoolroom attainments there was no more for them to learn, 
and Miss Wooler set them Blair&rsquo;s <!-- page 235--><a 
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span><i>Belles Lettres</i>
to commit to memory.&nbsp; We all laughed at their studies.&nbsp; Charlotte
persevered, but Mary took her own line, flatly refused, and accepted the 
penalty of disobedience, going supper-less to bed for about a month before 
she left school.&nbsp; When it was moonlight, we always found her engaged 
in drawing on the chest of drawers, which stood in the bay window, quite 
happy and cheerful.&nbsp; Her rebellion was never outspoken.&nbsp; She was 
always quiet in demeanour.&nbsp; Her sister Martha, on the contrary, spoke 
out vigorously, daring Miss Wooler so much, face to face, that she 
sometimes received a box on the ear, which hardly any saint could have 
withheld.&nbsp; Then Martha would expatiate on the danger of boxing ears, 
quoting a reverend brother of Miss Wooler&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Among her school 
companions, Martha was called &ldquo;Miss Boisterous,&rdquo; but was always
a favourite, so piquant and fascinating were her ways.&nbsp; She was not in
the least pretty, but something much better, full of change and variety, 
rudely outspoken, lively, and original, producing laughter with her own 
good-humour and affection.&nbsp; She was her father&rsquo;s pet 
child.&nbsp; He delighted in hearing her sing, telling her to go to the 
piano, with his affectionate &ldquo;Patty lass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mary never had the impromptu vivacity of her sister, but was 
lively in games that engaged her mind.&nbsp; Her music was very correct, 
but entirely cultivated by practice and perseverance.&nbsp; Anything 
underhand was detestable to both Mary and Martha; they had no mean pride 
towards others, but accepted the incidents of life with imperturbable 
good-sense and insight.&nbsp; They were not dressed as well as other 
pupils, for economy at that time was the rule of their household.&nbsp; The
girls had to stitch all over their new gloves before wearing them, by order
of their mother, to make them wear longer.&nbsp; Their dark blue cloth 
coats were worn when <i>too short</i>, and black beaver bonnets quite 
plainly trimmed, with the ease and contentment of a fashionable 
costume.&nbsp; Mr. Taylor was a banker as well as a monopolist of army 
cloth manufacture in the district.&nbsp; He lost money, and gave up 
banking.&nbsp; He set his mind on paying all creditors, and effected this 
during his lifetime as far as <!-- page 236--><a name="page236"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>possible, willing that his sons were to do the
remainder, which two of his sons carried out, as was understood, during 
their lifetime&mdash;Mark and Martin of <i>Shirley</i>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us now read Charlotte&rsquo;s description in <i>Shirley</i>, and I 
think we have a tolerably fair estimate of the sisters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;The two next are girls, Rose and Jessie; they are both now at 
their father&rsquo;s knee; they seldom go near their mother, except when 
obliged to do so.&nbsp; Rose, the elder, is twelve years old; she is like 
her father&mdash;the most like him of the whole group&mdash;but it is a 
granite head copied in ivory; all is softened in colour and line.&nbsp; 
Yorke himself has a harsh face; his daughter&rsquo;s is not harsh, neither 
is it quite pretty; it is simple&mdash;childlike in feature; the round 
cheeks bloom; as to the grey eyes, they are otherwise than 
childlike&mdash;a serious soul lights them&mdash;a young soul yet, but it 
will mature, if the body lives; and neither father nor mother has a spirit 
to compare with it.&nbsp; Partaking of the essence of each, it will one day
be better than either&mdash;stronger, much purer, more aspiring.&nbsp; Rose
is a still, and sometimes a stubborn girl now; her mother wants to make of 
her such a woman as she is herself&mdash;a woman of dark and dreary duties;
and Rose has a mind full-set, thick-sown with the germs of ideas her mother
never knew.&nbsp; It is agony to her often to have these ideas trampled on 
and repressed.&nbsp; She has never rebelled yet; but if hard driven, she 
will rebel one day, and then it will be once for all.&nbsp; Rose loves her 
father; her father does not rule her with a rod of iron; he is good to 
her.&nbsp; He sometimes fears she will not live, so bright are the sparks 
of intelligence which, at moments, flash from her glance and gleam in her 
language.&nbsp; This idea makes him often sadly tender to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has no idea that little Jessie will die young, she is so gay 
and chattering, arch&mdash;original even now; passionate when provoked, but
most affectionate if caressed; by turns gentle and rattling; exacting yet 
generous; fearless&mdash;of her mother, for instance, whose irrationally 
hard and strict rule she has often defied&mdash;yet reliant on any who will
help her.&nbsp; Jessie, with her <!-- page 237--><a 
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>little piquant face, 
engaging prattle, and winning ways, is made to be a pet; and her 
father&rsquo;s pet she accordingly is.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mary Taylor was called &lsquo;Pag&rsquo; by her friends, and the first 
important reference to her that I find is contained in a letter written by 
Charlotte to Ellen Nussey, when she was seventeen years of age.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>June</i> 20<i>th</i>, 1833.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I know you will be 
very angry because I have not written sooner; my reason, or rather my 
motive for this apparent neglect was, that I had determined not to write 
until I could ask you to pay us your long-promised visit.&nbsp; Aunt 
thought it would be better to defer it until about the middle of summer, as
the winter and even the spring seasons are remarkably cold and bleak among 
our mountains.&nbsp; Papa now desires me to present his respects to your 
mother, and say that he should feel greatly obliged if she would allow us 
the pleasure of your company for a few weeks at Haworth.&nbsp; I will leave
it to you to fix whatever day may be most convenient, but let it be an 
early one.&nbsp; I received a letter from Pag Taylor yesterday; she was in 
high dudgeon at my inattention in not promptly answering her last 
epistle.&nbsp; I however sat down immediately and wrote a very humble 
reply, candidly confessing my faults and soliciting forgiveness; I hope it 
has proved successful.&nbsp; Have you suffered much from that troublesome 
though not (I am happy to hear) generally fatal disease, the 
influenza?&nbsp; We have so far steered clear of it, but I know not how 
long we may continue to escape.&nbsp; Your last letter revealed a state of 
mind which seemed to promise much.&nbsp; As I read it I could not help 
wishing that my own feelings more resembled yours; but unhappily all the 
good thoughts that enter <i>my mind</i> evaporate almost before I have had 
time to ascertain their existence; every right resolution which I form is 
so transient, so fragile, and so easily broken, that I sometimes fear I 
shall never be what I ought.&nbsp; Earnestly hoping that this may not be 
your case, <!-- page 238--><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
238</span>that you may continue steadfast till the end,&mdash;I remain, 
dearest Ellen, your ever faithful friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Charlotte 
Bront&euml;</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next letter refers to Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; Mr. Taylor, it
is scarcely necessary to add, is the Mr. Yorke of Briarmains, who figures 
so largely in <i>Shirley</i>.&nbsp; I have visited the substantial 
red-brick house near the high-road at Gomersall, but descriptions of the 
Bront&euml; country do not come within the scope of this volume.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>January</i> 3<i>rd</i>, 1841.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I received the 
news in your last with no surprise, and with the feeling that this removal 
must be a relief to Mr. Taylor himself and even to his family.&nbsp; The 
bitterness of death was past a year ago, when it was first discovered that 
his illness must terminate fatally; all between has been lingering 
suspense.&nbsp; This is at an end now, and the present certainty, however 
sad, is better than the former doubt.&nbsp; What will be the consequence of
his death is another question; for my own part, I look forward to a 
dissolution and dispersion of the family, perhaps not immediately, but in 
the course of a year or two.&nbsp; It is true, causes may arise to keep 
them together awhile longer, but they are restless, active spirits, and 
will not be restrained always.&nbsp; Mary alone has more energy and power 
in her nature than any ten men you can pick out in the united parishes of 
Birstall and Haworth.&nbsp; It is vain to limit a character like hers 
within ordinary boundaries&mdash;she will overstep them.&nbsp; I am morally
certain Mary will establish her own landmarks, so will the rest of 
them.</p>

<p>Soon after her father&rsquo;s death Mary Taylor turned her eyes towards 
New Zealand, where she had friends, but two years were to go by before 
anything came of the idea.</p>

on at any rate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have got up my courage so far as to ask Mrs. White to grant me 
a day&rsquo;s holiday to go to Birstall to see Ellen Nussey, who has 
offered to send a gig for me.&nbsp; My request was granted, but so coldly 
and slowly.&nbsp; However, I stuck to my point in a very exemplary and 
remarkable manner.&nbsp; I hope to go next Saturday.&nbsp; Matters are 
progressing very strangely at Gomersall.&nbsp; Mary Taylor and Waring have 
come to a singular determination, but I almost think under the peculiar 
circumstances a defensible one, though it sounds outrageously odd at 
first.&nbsp; They are going to emigrate&mdash;to quit the country 
altogether.&nbsp; Their destination unless they change is Port Nicholson, 
in the northern island of New Zealand!!!&nbsp; Mary has made up her mind 
she can not and will not be a governess, a teacher, a milliner, a 
bonnet-maker nor housemaid.&nbsp; She sees no means of obtaining employment
she would like in England, so she is leaving it.&nbsp; I counselled her to 
go to France likewise and stay there a year before she decided on this 
strange unlikely-sounding plan of going to New Zealand, but she is quite 
resolved.&nbsp; I cannot sufficiently comprehend what her views and those 
of her brothers may be on the subject, or what is the extent of their 
information regarding Port Nicholson, to say whether this is rational 
enterprise or absolute madness.&nbsp; With love to papa, aunt, Tabby, 
etc.&mdash;Good-bye.</p>

<p>Soon after this Mary went on a long visit to Brussels, which, as we have
seen, was the direct cause of Charlotte and Emily establishing themselves 
at the Pensionnat H&eacute;ger.&nbsp; <!-- page 240--><a

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I received your 
letter from Mary, and you say I am to write though I have nothing to 
say.&nbsp; My sister will tell you all about me, for she has more time to

<p>&lsquo;Whilst Mary and John have been with me, we have been to Liege and
Spa, where we stayed eight days.&nbsp; I found my little knowledge of 
French very useful in our travels.&nbsp; I am going to begin working again 
very hard, now that John and Mary are going away.&nbsp; I intend beginning 
German directly.&nbsp; I would write some more but this pen of Mary&rsquo;s
won&rsquo;t write; you must scold her for it, and tell her to write you a 
long account of my proceedings.&nbsp; You must write to me sometimes.&nbsp;
George Dixon is coming here the last week in September, and you must send a
letter for me to Mary to be forwarded by him.&nbsp; Good-bye.&nbsp; May you
be happy.</p>

<p>It was while Charlotte was making her second stay in Brussels that she 
heard of Mary&rsquo;s determination to go with her brother Waring to New 
Zealand, with a view to earning her own living in any reasonable manner 
that might offer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;That last letter of 
yours merits a good dose of panegyric&mdash;it was both long and 
interesting; send me quickly such another, longer still if possible.&nbsp; 
You will have heard of Mary Taylor&rsquo;s resolute and intrepid 
proceedings.&nbsp; Her public letters will have put you in possession of 
all details&mdash;nothing is left for me to say except perhaps to express 
my opinion upon it.&nbsp; I have turned the matter over on all sides and 
really I cannot consider it otherwise than as very rational.&nbsp; Mind, I

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;You probably know 
that another letter has been received from Mary Taylor.&nbsp; It is, 
however, possible that your absence from home will have prevented your 
seeing it, so I will give you a sketch of its contents.&nbsp; It was 
written at about 4&deg; N. of the Equator.&nbsp; The first part of the 
letter contained an account of their landing at Santiago.&nbsp; Her health 
at that time was very good, and her spirits seemed excellent.&nbsp; They 
had had contrary winds at first setting out, but their voyage was then 
prosperous.&nbsp; In the latter portion of the letter she complains of the 
excessive heat, and says she lives chiefly on oranges; but still she was 
well, and freer from headache and other ailments than any other person on 
board.&nbsp; The receipt of this letter will have relieved all her friends 
from a weight of anxiety.&nbsp; I am uneasy about what you say respecting 
the French newspapers&mdash;do you mean to intimate that you have received 
none?&nbsp; I have despatched them regularly.&nbsp; Emily and I keep them 
usually three days, sometimes only two, and then send them forward to 
you.&nbsp; I see by the cards you sent, and also by the newspaper, that 
Henry is at last married.&nbsp; How did you like your office of bridesmaid?
and how do you like your new sister and her family?&nbsp; You must write to
me as soon as you can, and give me an <i>observant</i> account of 
everything.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I return you Mary

is not quite content with her existence in New Zealand.&nbsp; She finds it 
too barren.&nbsp; I believe she is more home-sick than she will 
confess.&nbsp; Her gloomy ideas respecting you and me prove a state of mind

your own, and its contents too.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I should have 
answered your last long ago if I had known your address, but you omitted to
give it me, and I have been waiting in the hope that you would perhaps 
write again and repair the omission.&nbsp; Finding myself deceived in this 
expectation however, I have at last hit on the plan of sending the letter 
to Brookroyd to be directed; be sure to give me your address when you reply
to this.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was glad to hear that you were well received at London, and 
that you got safe to the end of your journey.&nbsp; Your 
<i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> in <!-- page 243--><a name="page243"></a><span

&ldquo;last new novel&rdquo; amuses me.&nbsp; We do not subscribe to a 
circulating library at Haworth, and consequently &ldquo;new novels&rdquo; 
rarely indeed come in our way, and consequently, again, we are not 
qualified to give opinions thereon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;About three weeks ago, I received a brief note from Hunsworth, to
the effect that Mr. Joe Taylor and his cousin Henry would make some 
inquiries respecting Mme.&nbsp; H&eacute;ger&rsquo;s school on account of 
Ellen Taylor, and that if I had no objection, they would ride over to 
Haworth in a day or two.&nbsp; I said they might come if they would.&nbsp; 
They came, accompanied by Miss Mossman, of Bradford, whom I had never seen,
only heard of occasionally.&nbsp; It was a pouring wet and windy day; we 
had quite ceased to expect them.&nbsp; Miss Mossman was quite wet, and we 
had to make her change her things, and dress her out in ours as well as we 
could.&nbsp; I do not know if you are acquainted with her; I thought her 
unaffected and rather agreeable-looking, though she has very red 
hair.&nbsp; Henry Taylor does indeed resemble John most strongly.&nbsp; Joe
looked thin; he was in good spirits, and I think in tolerable 
good-humour.&nbsp; I would have given much for you to have been 
there.&nbsp; I had not been very well for some days before, and had some 
difficulty in keeping up the talk, but I managed on the whole better than I
expected.&nbsp; I was glad Miss Mossman came, for she helped.&nbsp; Nothing
new was communicated respecting Mary.&nbsp; Nothing of importance in any 
way was said the whole time; it was all rattle, rattle, of which I should 
have great difficulty now in recalling the substance.&nbsp; They left 
almost immediately after tea.&nbsp; I have not heard a word respecting them
since, but I suppose they got home all right.&nbsp; The visit strikes me as
an odd whim.&nbsp; I consider it quite a caprice, prompted probably by 
curiosity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Joe Taylor mentioned that he had called at Brookroyd, and that 
Anne had told him you were ill, and going into the South for change of 
air.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope you will soon write to me again and tell me particularly 
how your health is, and how you get on.&nbsp; Give my <!-- page 244--><a

<p>The Ellen Taylor mentioned in the above letter did not go to

<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS CHARLOTTE BRONT&Euml;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, 
<i>April</i> 10<i>th</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Charlotte</span>,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been 
delighted to receive a very interesting letter from you with an account of 
your visit to London, etc.&nbsp; I believe I have tacked this 
acknowledgment to the tail of my last letter to you, but since then it has 
dawned on my comprehension that you are becoming a very important personage
in this little world, and therefore, d&rsquo;ye see? I must write again to 
you.&nbsp; I wish you would give me some account of Newby, and what the man
said when confronted with the real Ellis Bell.&nbsp; By the way, having got
your secret, will he keep it?&nbsp; And how do you contrive to get your 
letters under the address of Mr. Bell?&nbsp; The whole scheme must be 
particularly interesting to hear about, if I could only talk to you for 
half a day.&nbsp; When do you intend to tell the good people about you?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am now hard at work expecting Ellen Taylor.&nbsp; She may 
possibly be here in two months.&nbsp; I once thought of writing you some of
the dozens of schemes I have for Ellen Taylor, but as the choice depends on
her I may as well wait and tell you the one she chooses.&nbsp; The two most
reasonable are keeping a school and keeping a shop.&nbsp; The last is 
evidently the most healthy, but the most difficult of accomplishment.&nbsp;
I have written an account of the earthquakes for <i>Chambers</i>, and 
intend (now don&rsquo;t remind me of this a year hence, because <i>la femme
propose</i>) to write some more.&nbsp; What else I shall do I don&rsquo;t 
know.&nbsp; I find the writing faculty does not in the least depend on the 
leisure I have, but much more on the <i>active</i> work I have to do.&nbsp;
I write at my novel a little and think of my other book.&nbsp; What this 
will turn out, God only knows.&nbsp; It is not, and never can be 
forgotten.&nbsp; It is my child, my baby, and <i>I assure you</i> such a 
<!-- page 245--><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<span class="smcap">New Zealand</span>,<br />
&lsquo;<i>July</i> 24<i>th</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Charlotte</span>,&mdash;About a month 
since I received and read <i>Jane Eyre</i>.&nbsp; It seemed to me 
incredible that you had actually written a book.&nbsp; Such events did not 
happen while I was in England.&nbsp; I begin to believe in your existence 
much as I do in Mr. Rochester&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In a believing mood I 
don&rsquo;t doubt either of them.&nbsp; After I had read it I went on to 
the top of Mount Victoria and looked for a ship to carry a letter to 
you.&nbsp; There was a little thing with one mast, and also H.M.S. 
<i>Fly</i>, and nothing else.&nbsp; If a cattle vessel came from Sydney she
would probably return in a few days, and would take a mail, but we have had
east wind for a month and nothing can come in.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Aug</i>. 1.&mdash;The <i>Harlequin</i> has just come from 
Otago, and is to sail for Singapore <i>when the wind changes</i>, and by 
that route (which I hope to take myself sometime) I send you this.&nbsp; 
Much good may it do you.&nbsp; Your novel surprised me by being so perfect 
as a work of art.&nbsp; I expected something more changeable and 
unfinished.&nbsp; You have polished to some purpose.&nbsp; If I were to do 
so I should get tired, and weary every one else in about two pages.&nbsp; 
No sign of this weariness in your book&mdash;you must have had abundance, 
having kept it all to yourself!</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are very different from me in having no doctrine to 
preach.&nbsp; It is impossible to squeeze a moral out of your 
production.&nbsp; Has the world gone so well with you that you have no 
protest to make against its absurdities?&nbsp; Did you never sneer or 
declaim in your first sketches?&nbsp; I will scold you well when I see 
you.&nbsp; I do not believe in Mr. Rivers.&nbsp; There are no <i>good</i> 
men of the Brocklehurst species.&nbsp; A missionary either goes into his 
office for a piece of bread, or <!-- page 246--><a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>he goes from enthusiasm, and that is both too 
good and too bad a quality for St. John.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a bit of your 
absurd charity to believe in such a man.&nbsp; You have done wisely in 
choosing to imagine a high class of readers.&nbsp; You never stop to 
explain or defend anything, and never seem bothered with the idea.&nbsp; If
Mrs. Fairfax or any other well-intentioned fool gets hold of this what will
she think?&nbsp; And yet, you know, the world is made up of such, and 
worse.&nbsp; Once more, how have you written through three volumes without 
declaring war to the knife against a few dozen absurd doctrines, each of 
which is supported by &ldquo;a large and respectable class of 
readers&rdquo;?&nbsp; Emily seems to have had such a class in her eye when 
she wrote that strange thing <i>Wuthering Heights</i>.&nbsp; Anne, too, 
stops repeatedly to preach commonplace truths.&nbsp; She has had a still 
lower class in her mind&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; Emily seems to have followed the
bookseller&rsquo;s advice.&nbsp; As to the price you got, it was certainly 
Jewish.&nbsp; But what could the people do?&nbsp; If they had asked you to 
fix it, do you know yourself how many ciphers your sum would have 
had?&nbsp; And how should they know better?&nbsp; And if they did, 
that&rsquo;s the knowledge they get their living by.&nbsp; If I were in 
your place, the idea of being bound in the sale of two more would prevent 
me from ever writing again.&nbsp; Yet you are probably now busy with 
another.&nbsp; It is curious for me to see among the old letters one from 
Anne sending <i>a copy of a whole article</i> on the currency question 
written by Fonblanque!&nbsp; I exceedingly regret having burnt your letters
in a fit of caution, and I&rsquo;ve forgotten all the names.&nbsp; Was the 
reader Albert Smith?&nbsp; What do they all think of you?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mention the book to no one and hear no opinions.&nbsp; I lend 
it a good deal because it&rsquo;s a novel, and <i>it&rsquo;s as good as 
another</i>!&nbsp; They say &ldquo;it makes them cry.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are
not literary enough to give an opinion.&nbsp; If ever I hear one I&rsquo;ll
embalm it for you.&nbsp; As to my own affair, I have written 100 pages, and
lately 50 more.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no use writing faster.&nbsp; I get so 
disgusted, I can do nothing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I could command sufficient money for a twelve-month, I would 
go home by way of India and write my travels, which <!-- page 247--><a 
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>would prepare the way
for my novel.&nbsp; With the benefit of your experience I should perhaps 
make a better bargain than you.&nbsp; I am most afraid of my health.&nbsp; 
Not that I should die, but perhaps sink into a state of betweenity, neither
well nor ill, in which I should observe nothing, and be very miserable 
besides.&nbsp; My life here is not disagreeable.&nbsp; I have a great 
resource in the piano, and a little employment in teaching.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you don&rsquo;t live in this world, that I 
might entertain you about the price of meat.&nbsp; Do you know, I bought 
six heifers the other day for &pound;23, and now it is turned so cold I 
expect to hear one-half of them are dead.&nbsp; One man bought twenty sheep
for &pound;8, and they are all dead but one.&nbsp; Another bought 150 and 
has 40 left.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have now told you everything I can think of except that the 
cat&rsquo;s on the table and that I&rsquo;m going to borrow a new book to 
read&mdash;no less than an account of all the systems of philosophy of 
modern Europe.&nbsp; I have lately met with a wonder, a man who thinks Jane
Eyre would have done better to marry Mr. Rivers!&nbsp; He gives no 
reason&mdash;such people never do.</p>

<span class="smcap">New Zealand</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Charlotte</span>,&mdash;I have set up 
shop!&nbsp; I am delighted with it as a whole&mdash;that is, it is as 
pleasant or as little disagreeable as you can expect an employment to be 
that you earn your living by.&nbsp; The best of it is that your labour has 
some return, and you are not forced to work on hopelessly without 
result.&nbsp; <i>Du reste</i>, it is very odd.&nbsp; I keep looking at 
myself with one eye while I&rsquo;m using the other, and I sometimes find 
myself in very queer positions.&nbsp; Yesterday I went along the shore past
the wharfes and several warehouses on a street where I had never been 
before during all the five years I have been in Wellington.&nbsp; I opened 
the door of a long place filled with packages, with passages up the middle,
and a row of high windows on one side.&nbsp; At the far end of the room a 
man was writing at a desk beneath a window.&nbsp; I walked all the length 
of the room very slowly, for <!-- page 248--><a name="page248"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>what I had come for had completely gone out of
my head.&nbsp; Fortunately the man never heard me until I had recollected 
it.&nbsp; Then he got up, and I asked him for some stone-blue, saltpetre, 
tea, pickles, salt, etc.&nbsp; He was very civil.&nbsp; I bought some 
things and asked for a note of them.&nbsp; He went to his desk again; I 
looked at some newspapers lying near.&nbsp; On the top was a circular from 
Smith &amp; Elder containing notices of the most important new works.&nbsp;
The first and longest was given to <i>Shirley</i>, a book I had seen 
mentioned in the <i>Manchester Examiner</i> as written by Currer 
Bell.&nbsp; I blushed all over.&nbsp; The man got up, folding the 
note.&nbsp; I pulled it out of his hand and set off to the door, looking 
odder than ever, for a partner had come in and was watching.&nbsp; The 
clerk said something about sending them, and I said something too&mdash;I 
hope it was not very silly&mdash;and took my departure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have seen some extracts from <i>Shirley</i> in which you talk 
of women working.&nbsp; And this first duty, this great necessity, you seem
to think that some women may indulge in, if they give up marriage, and 
don&rsquo;t make themselves too disagreeable to the other sex.&nbsp; You 
are a coward and a traitor.&nbsp; A woman who works is by that alone better
than one who does not; and a woman who does not happen to be rich and who 
<i>still</i> earns no money and does not wish to do so, is guilty of a 
great fault, almost a crime&mdash;a dereliction of duty which leads rapidly
and almost certainly to all manner of degradation.&nbsp; It is very wrong 
of you to <i>plead</i> for toleration for workers on the ground of their 
being in peculiar circumstances, and few in number or singular in 
disposition.&nbsp; Work or degradation is the lot of all except the very 
small number born to wealth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ellen is with me, or I with her.&nbsp; I cannot tell how our shop
will turn out, but I am as sanguine as ever.&nbsp; Meantime we certainly 
amuse ourselves better than if we had nothing to do.&nbsp; We <i>like</i> 
it, and that&rsquo;s the truth.&nbsp; By the <i>Cornelia</i> we are going 
to send our sketches and fern leaves.&nbsp; You must look at them, and it 
will need all your eyes to understand them, for they are a mass of 
confusion.&nbsp; They are all within two miles of Wellington, and some of 
them rather like&mdash;Ellen&rsquo;s sketch of <!-- page 249--><a 
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>me especially.&nbsp; 
During the last six months I have seen more &ldquo;society&rdquo; than in 
all the last four years.&nbsp; Ellen is half the reason of my being 
invited, and my improved circumstances besides.&nbsp; There is no one worth
mentioning particularly.&nbsp; The women are all ignorant and narrow, and 
the men selfish.&nbsp; They are of a decent, honest kind, and some 
intelligent and able.&nbsp; A Mr. Woodward is the only <i>literary</i> man 
we know, and he seems to have fair sense.&nbsp; This was the clerk I bought
the stone-blue of.&nbsp; We have just got a mechanic&rsquo;s institute, and
weekly lectures delivered there.&nbsp; It is amusing to see people trying 
to find out whether or not it is fashionable and proper to patronise 
it.&nbsp; Somehow it seems it is.&nbsp; I think I have told you all this 
before, which shows I have got to the end of my news.&nbsp; Your next 
letter to me ought to bring me good news, more cheerful than the 
last.&nbsp; You will somehow get drawn out of your hole and find interests 
among your fellow-creatures.&nbsp; Do you know that living among people 
with whom you have not the slightest interest in common is just like living
alone, or worse?&nbsp; Ellen Nussey is the only one you can talk to, that I
know of at least.&nbsp; Give my love to her and to Miss Wooler, if you have
the opportunity.&nbsp; I am writing this on just such a night as you will 
likely read it&mdash;rain and storm, coming winter, and a glowing 
fire.&nbsp; Ours is on the ground, wood, no fender or irons; no matter, we 
are very comfortable.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Charlotte</span>,&mdash;About a week 
since I received your last melancholy letter with the account of 
Anne&rsquo;s death and your utter indifference to everything, even to the 
success of your last book.&nbsp; Though you do not say this, it is pretty 
plain to be seen from the style of your letter.&nbsp; It seems to me hard 
indeed that you who would succeed, better than any one, in making friends 
and keeping them, should be condemned to solitude from your poverty.&nbsp; 
To no one would money bring more happiness, for no one would use it better 
than you would.&nbsp; For me, <!-- page 250--><a name="page250"></a><span

perhaps better without it, but I am convinced it would give you great and 
noble pleasures.&nbsp; Look out then for success in writing; you ought to 
care as much for that as you do for going to Heaven.&nbsp; Though the 
advantages of being employed appear to you now the best part of the

<p>&lsquo;I have got into a heap of social trickery since Ellen came, never
having troubled my head before about the comparative numbers of young 
ladies and young gentlemen.&nbsp; To Ellen it is quite new to be of such 
importance by the mere fact of her femininity.&nbsp; She thought she was 
coming wofully down in the world when she came out, and finds herself 
better received than ever she was in her life before.&nbsp; And the class 
are not <i>in education</i> inferior, though they are in money.&nbsp; They 
are decent well-to-do people: six grocers, one draper, two parsons, two 
clerks, two lawyers, and three or four nondescripts.&nbsp; All these but 
one have families to &ldquo;take tea with,&rdquo; and there are a lot more 
single men to flirt with.&nbsp; For the last three months we have been out 
every Sunday sketching.&nbsp; We seldom succeed in making the slightest 
resemblance to the thing we sit down to, but it is wonderfully 
interesting.&nbsp; Next year we hope to send a lot home.&nbsp; With all 
this my novel stands still; it might have done so if I had had nothing to 
do, for it is not want of time but want of freedom of mind that makes me 
unable to direct my attention to it.&nbsp; Meantime it grows in my head, 
for I never give up the idea.&nbsp; I have written about a volume I 
suppose.&nbsp; Read this letter to Ellen Nussey.</p>

<i>August</i> 13<i>th</i>, 1850.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Charlotte</span>,&mdash;After waiting 
about six months we have just got <i>Shirley</i>.&nbsp; It was landed from 
the <i>Constantinople</i> on Monday afternoon, just in the thick of our 
preparations for a <!-- page 251--><a name="page251"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>&ldquo;small party&rdquo; for the next 
day.&nbsp; We stopped spreading red blankets over everything (New Zealand 
way of arranging the room) and opened the box and read all the 
letters.&nbsp; Soyer&rsquo;s <i>Housewife</i> and <i>Shirley</i> were there
all right, but Miss Martineau&rsquo;s book was not.&nbsp; In its place was 
a silly child&rsquo;s tale called <i>Edward Orland</i>.&nbsp; On Tuesday we
stayed up dancing till three or four o&rsquo;clock, what for I can&rsquo;t 
imagine.&nbsp; However, it was a piece of business done.&nbsp; On Wednesday
I began <i>Shirley</i> and continued in a curious confusion of mind till 
now, principally at the handsome foreigner who was nursed in our house when
I was a little girl.&nbsp; By the way, you&rsquo;ve put him in the 
servant&rsquo;s bedroom.&nbsp; You make us all talk much as I think we 
should have done if we&rsquo;d ventured to speak at all.&nbsp; What a 
little lump of perfection you&rsquo;ve made me!&nbsp; There is a strange 
feeling in reading it of hearing us all talking.&nbsp; I have not seen the 
matted hall and painted parlour windows so plain these five years.&nbsp; 
But my father is not like.&nbsp; He hates well enough and perhaps loves 
too, but he is not honest enough.&nbsp; It was from my father I learnt not 
to marry for money nor to tolerate any one who did, and he never would 
advise any one to do so, or fail to speak with contempt of those who 
did.&nbsp; Shirley is much more interesting than Jane Eyre, who never 
interests you at all until she has something to suffer.&nbsp; All through 
this last novel there is so much more life and stir that it leaves you far 
more to remember than the other.&nbsp; Did you go to London about this 
too?&nbsp; What for?&nbsp; I see by a letter of yours to Mr. Dixon that you
<i>have</i> been.&nbsp; I wanted to contradict some of your opinions, now I
can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; As to when I&rsquo;m coming home, you may well 
ask.&nbsp; I have wished for fifteen years to begin to earn my own living; 
last April I began to try&mdash;it is too soon to say yet with what 
success.&nbsp; I am woefully ignorant, terribly wanting in tact, and 
obstinately lazy, and almost too old to mend.&nbsp; Luckily there is no 
other dance for me, so I must work.&nbsp; Ellen takes to it kindly, it 
gratifies a deep ardent <i>wish</i> of hers as of mine, and she is 
habitually industrious.&nbsp; For <i>her</i>, ten years younger, our shop 
will be a blessing.&nbsp; She may possibly secure an independence, and 
skill to keep it and use it, before the prime of life <!-- page 252--><a 
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>is past.&nbsp; As to 
my writings, you may as well ask the Fates about that too.&nbsp; I can give
you no information.&nbsp; I write a page now and then.&nbsp; I never forget
or get strange to what I have written.&nbsp; When I read it over it looks 
very interesting.</p>

<p>The Ellen Taylor referred to so frequently was, as I have said, a cousin
of Mary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Her early death in New Zealand gives the single 
letter I have of hers a more pathetic interest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS CHARLOTTE BRONT&Euml;</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Wellington</span>, 
<span class="smcap">N. Z.</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Bront&euml;</span>,&mdash;I 
shall tell you everything I can think of, since you said in one of your 
letters to Pag that you wished me to write to you.&nbsp; I have been here a
year.&nbsp; It seems a much shorter time, and yet I have thought more and 
done more than I ever did in my life before.&nbsp; When we arrived, Henry 
and I were in such a hurry to leave the ship that we didn&rsquo;t wait to 
be fetched, but got into the first boat that came alongside.&nbsp; When we 
landed we inquired where Waring lived, but hadn&rsquo;t walked far before 
we met him.&nbsp; I had never seen him before, but he guessed we were the 
cousins he expected, so caught us and took us along with him.&nbsp; Mary 
soon joined us, and we went home together.&nbsp; At first I thought Mary 
was not the least altered, but when I had seen her for about a week I 
thought she looked rather older.&nbsp; The first night Mary and I sat up 
till 2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> talking.&nbsp; Mary and I settled we
would do something together, and we talked for a fortnight before we 
decided whether we would have a school or shop; it ended in favour of the 
shop.&nbsp; Waring thought we had better be quiet, and I believe he still 
thinks we are doing it for amusement; but he never refuses to help 
us.&nbsp; He is teaching us book-keeping, and he buys things for us now and
then.&nbsp; Mary gets as fierce as a dragon and goes to all the wholesale 
stores and looks at things, gets patterns, samples, etc., and asks prices, 
and then comes home, and we talk it over; and then she goes again and buys 
what we want.&nbsp; She says the <!-- page 253--><a 
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>people are always 
civil to her.&nbsp; Our keeping shop astonishes every body here; I believe 
they think we do it for fun.&nbsp; Some think we shall make nothing of it, 
or that we shall get tired; and all laugh at us.&nbsp; Before I left home I
used to be afraid of being laughed at, but now it has very little effect 
upon me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mary and I are settled together now: I can&rsquo;t do without 
Mary and she couldn&rsquo;t get on by herself.&nbsp; I built the house we 
live in, and we made the plan ourselves, so it suits us.&nbsp; We take it 
in turns to serve in the shop, and keep the accounts, and do the 
housework&mdash;I mean, Mary takes the shop for a week and I the kitchen, 
and then we change.&nbsp; I think we shall do very well if no more severe 
earthquakes come, and if we can prevent fire.&nbsp; When a wooden house 
takes fire it doesn&rsquo;t stop; and we have got an oil cask about as high
as I am, that would help it.&nbsp; If some sparks go out at the chimney-top
the shingles are in danger.&nbsp; The last earthquake but one about a 
fortnight ago threw down two medicine bottles that were standing on the 
table and made other things jingle, but did no damage.&nbsp; If we have 
nothing worse than that I don&rsquo;t care, but I don&rsquo;t want the 
chimney to come down&mdash;it would cost &pound;10 to build it up 
again.&nbsp; Mary is making me stop because it is nearly 9 <span 
class="smcap">p.m.</span> and we are going to Waring&rsquo;s to 
supper.&nbsp; Good-bye.&mdash;Yours truly,</p>

<i>July</i> 4<i>th</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I get on as well as I can.&nbsp; Home is not the home it used to 
be&mdash;that you may well conceive; but so far, I get on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot boast of vast benefits derived from change of air yet; 
but unfortunately I brought back the seeds of a cold with me from that 
dismal Easton, and I have not got rid of it yet.&nbsp; Still I think I look
better than I did before I went.&nbsp; How are you?&nbsp; You have never 
told me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Williams has written to me twice since my return, chiefly on 
the subject of his third daughter, who wishes to be a governess, and has 
some chances of a presentation to Queen&rsquo;s College, an establishment 
connected with the Governess Institution; <!-- page 254--><a 
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>this will secure her 
four years of instruction.&nbsp; He says Mr. George Smith is kindly using 
his influence to obtain votes, but there are so many candidates he is not 
sanguine of success.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had a long letter from Mary Taylor&mdash;interesting but sad, 
because it contained many allusions to those who are in this world no 
more.&nbsp; She mentioned you, and seemed impressed with an idea of the 
lamentable nature of your unoccupied life.&nbsp; She spoke of her own 
health as being excellent.</p>

<span class="smcap">N. Z.</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Charlotte</span>,&mdash;I began a letter
to you one bitter cold evening last week, but it turned out such a sad one 
that I have left it and begun again.&nbsp; I am sitting all alone in my own
house, or rather what is to be mine when I&rsquo;ve paid for it.&nbsp; I 
bought it of Henry when Ellen died&mdash;shop and all, and carry on by 
myself.&nbsp; I have made up my mind not to get any assistance.&nbsp; I 
have not too much work, and the annoyance of having an unsuitable companion
was too great to put up with without necessity.&nbsp; I find now that it 
was Ellen that made me so busy, and without her to nurse I have plenty of 
time.&nbsp; I have begun to keep the house very tidy; it makes it less 
desolate.&nbsp; I take great interest in my trade&mdash;as much as I could 
do in anything that was not <i>all</i> pleasure.&nbsp; But the best part of
my life is the excitement of arrivals from England.&nbsp; Reading all the 
news, written and printed, is like living another life quite separate from 
this one.&nbsp; The old letters are strange&mdash;very, when <!-- page 
255--><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>I begin to 
read them, but quite familiar notwithstanding.&nbsp; So are all the books 
and newspapers, though I never see a human being to whom it would ever 
occur to me to mention anything I read in them.&nbsp; I see your <i>nom de 
guerre</i> in them sometimes.&nbsp; I saw a criticism on the preface to the
second edition of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>.&nbsp; I saw it among the 
notables who attended Thackeray&rsquo;s lectures.&nbsp; I have seen it 
somehow connected with Sir J. K. Shuttleworth.&nbsp; Did he want to marry 
you, or only to lionise you? <i>or was it somebody else</i>?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your life in London is a &ldquo;new country&rdquo; to me, which I
cannot even picture to myself.&nbsp; You seem to like it&mdash;at least 
some things in it, and yet your late letters to Mrs. J. Taylor talk of low 
spirits and illness.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you 
now?&rdquo; as my mother used to say, as if it were the twentieth time in a
fortnight.&nbsp; It is really melancholy that now, in the prime of life, in
the flush of your hard-earned prosperity, you can&rsquo;t be well.&nbsp; 
Did not Miss Martineau improve you?&nbsp; If she did, why not try her and 
her plan again?&nbsp; But I suppose if you had hope and energy to try, you 
would be well.&nbsp; Well, it&rsquo;s nearly dark and you will surely be 
well when you read this, so what&rsquo;s the use of writing?&nbsp; I should
like well to have some details of your life, but how can I hope for 
it?&nbsp; I have often tried to give you a picture of mine, but I have not 
the skill.&nbsp; I get a heap of details, mostly paltry in themselves, and 
not enough to give you an idea of the whole.&nbsp; Oh, for one hour&rsquo;s
talk!&nbsp; You are getting too far off and beginning to look strange to 
me.&nbsp; Do you look as you used to do, I wonder?&nbsp; What do you and 
Ellen Nussey talk about when you meet?&nbsp; There! it&rsquo;s dark.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Sunday night</i>.&mdash;I have let the vessel go that was to 
take this.&nbsp; As there were others going soon I did not much care.&nbsp;
I am in the height of cogitation whether to send for some worsted 
stockings, etc.&nbsp; They will come next year at this time, and who can 
tell what I shall want then, or shall be doing?&nbsp; Yet hitherto we have 
sent such orders, and have guessed or known pretty well what we should 
want.&nbsp; I have just been looking over a list of four pages long in 
Ellen&rsquo;s handwriting.&nbsp; These things ought to come by the next 
vessel, or part of them at least.&nbsp; <!-- page 256--><a 
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>When tired of that I 
began to read some pages of &ldquo;my book&rdquo; intending to write some 
more, but went on reading for pleasure.&nbsp; I often do this, and find it 
very interesting indeed.&nbsp; It does not get on fast, though I have 
written about one volume and a half.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s full of music, 
poverty, disputing, politics, and original views of life.&nbsp; I 
can&rsquo;t for the life of me bring the lover into it, nor tell what 
he&rsquo;s to do when he comes.&nbsp; Of the men generally I can never tell
what they&rsquo;ll do next.&nbsp; The women I understand pretty well, and 
rare <i>tracasserie</i> there is among them&mdash;they are perfectly 
<i>feminine</i> in that respect at least.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am just now in a state of famine.&nbsp; No books and no news 
from England for this two months.&nbsp; I am thinking of visiting a 
circulating library from sheer dulness.&nbsp; If I had more time I should 
get melancholy.&nbsp; No one can prize activity more than I do.&nbsp; I 
never am long without it than a gloom comes over me.&nbsp; The cloud seems 
to be always there behind me, and never quite out of sight but when I keep 
on at a good rate.&nbsp; Fortunately, the more I work the better I like 
it.&nbsp; I shall take to scrubbing the floor before it&rsquo;s dirty and 
polishing pans on the outside in my old age.&nbsp; It is the only thing 
that gives me an appetite for dinner.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;A few days ago I got
a letter from you, dated 2nd May 1856, along with some patterns and 
fashion-book.&nbsp; They seem to have been lost somehow, as the box ought 
to have come by the <i>Hastings</i>, and only now makes its appearance by 
the <i>Philip Lang</i>.&nbsp; It has come very <i>apropos</i> for a new 
year&rsquo;s gift, and the patterns were not opened twenty-four hours 
before a silk cape was cut out by one of them.&nbsp; I think I made a very 
impertinent request when I asked you to give yourself so much 
trouble.&nbsp; The poor woman for whom I wanted them is now a first-rate 
dressmaker&mdash;her drunken husband, who was her main misfortune, having 
taken himself off and not been heard of lately.</p>

the <i>Life</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish I had kept Charlotte&rsquo;s letters now, though I never 
felt it safe to do so until latterly that I have had a home of my 
own.&nbsp; They would have been much better evidence than my imperfect 
recollection, and infinitely more interesting.&nbsp; A settled opinion is 
very likely to look absurd unless you give the grounds for it, and even if 
I could remember them it might look as if there might be other facts which 
I have neglected which ought to have altered it.&nbsp; Your news of the 
&ldquo;neighbours&rdquo; is very interesting, especially of Miss Wooler and
my old schoolfellows.&nbsp; I wish I knew how to give you some account of 
my ways here and the effect of my position on me.&nbsp; First of all, it 
agrees with me.&nbsp; I am in better health than at any time since I left 
school.&nbsp; My life now is not overburdened with work, and what I do has 
interest and attraction in it.&nbsp; I think it is that part that I shall 
think most agreeable when I look back on my death-bed&mdash;a number of 
small pleasures scattered over my way, that, when seen from a distance, 
will seem to cover it thick.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t cover it by any means, 
but I never had so many.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I look after my shopwoman, make out bills, decide who shall have 
&ldquo;trust&rdquo; and who not.&nbsp; Then I go a-buying, not near such an
anxious piece of business now that I understand my trade, and have, 
moreover, a good &ldquo;credit.&rdquo;&nbsp; I read a good deal, sometimes 
on the sofa, a vice I am much given to in hot weather.&nbsp; Then I have 
some friends&mdash;not many, and no geniuses, which fact pray keep strictly
to yourself, for how the doings and sayings of Wellington people in England
always come out again to New Zealand!&nbsp; They are not very interesting 
any way.&nbsp; This is my fault in part, for I can&rsquo;t take interest in
their concerns.&nbsp; A book is worth any of them, and a good book worth 
them all put together.</p>

that you are leaving Brookroyd.&nbsp; I shall not even see Brookroyd again,
and one of the people who lived there; and <i>one</i> whom I used to see 
there I shall never see more.&nbsp; Keep yourself well, dear Ellen, and 
gather round you as much happiness and interest as you can, and let me find
you cheery and thriving when I come.&nbsp; When that will be I don&rsquo;t 
yet know; but one thing is sure, I have given over ordering goods from 
England, so that I must sometime give over for want of anything to 
sell.&nbsp; The last things ordered I expect to arrive about the beginning 
of the year 1859.&nbsp; In the course of that year, therefore, I shall be 
left without anything to do or motive for staying.&nbsp; Possibly this time
twelve months I may be leaving Wellington.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are here in the height of a political crisis.&nbsp; The 
election for the highest office in the province (Superintendent) comes off 
in about a fortnight.&nbsp; There is altogether a small storm going on in 
our teacup, quite brisk enough to stir everything in it.&nbsp; My principal
interest therein is the sale of election ribbons, though I am afraid, owing
to the bad weather, there will be little display.&nbsp; Besides the 
elections, there is nothing interesting.&nbsp; We all go on pretty 
well.&nbsp; I have got a pony about four feet high, that carries me about 
ten miles from Wellington, which is much more than walking distance, to 
which I have been confined for the last ten years.&nbsp; I have given over 
most of the work to Miss Smith, who will finally take the business, and if 
we had fine weather I think I should enjoy myself.&nbsp; My main want here 
is for books enough to fill up my idle time.&nbsp; It seems to me that when
I get home I will spend half my income on books, and sell them when I have 
read them to make it go further.&nbsp; I know this is absurd, but people 
with an unsatisfied appetite think they can eat enormously.</p>

259</span>Miss Taylor wrote one or two useful letters to Mrs. Gaskell, 
while the latter was preparing her Memoir of Charlotte Bront&euml;, and her
favourable estimate of the book we have already seen.&nbsp; About 1859 or 
1860 she returned to England and lived out the remainder of her days in 
complete seclusion in a Yorkshire home that she built for herself.&nbsp; 
The novel to which she refers in a letter to her friend never seems to have
got itself written, or at least published, for it was not until 1890 that 
Miss Mary Taylor produced a work of fiction&mdash;<i>Miss Miles</i>. <a 
name="citation259a"></a><a href="#footnote259a" 
class="citation">[259a]</a>&nbsp; This novel strives to inculcate the 
advantages as well as the duty of women learning to make themselves 
independent of men.&nbsp; It is well, though not brilliantly written, and 
might, had the author possessed any of the latter-day gifts of 
self-advertisement, have attracted the public, if only by the mere fact 
that its author was a friend of Currer Bell&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But Miss Taylor,
it is clear, hated advertisement, and severely refused to be lionised by 
Bront&euml; worshippers.&nbsp; Twenty years earlier than <i>Miss Miles</i>,
I may add, she had preached the same gospel in less attractive guise.&nbsp;
A series of papers in the <i>Victorian Magazine</i> were reprinted under 
the title of <i>The First Duty of Women</i>. <a name="citation259b"></a><a 
href="#footnote259b" class="citation">[259b]</a>&nbsp; &lsquo;To inculcate 
the duty of earning money,&rsquo; she declares, &lsquo;is the principal 
point in these articles.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;It is to the feminine half of 
the world that the commonplace duty of providing for themselves is 
recommended,&rsquo; and she enforces her doctrine with considerable point, 
and by means of arguments much more accepted in our day than in hers.&nbsp;
Miss Taylor died in March 1893, at High Royd, in Yorkshire, at the age of 
seventy-six.&nbsp; She will always occupy an honourable place in the 
Bront&euml; story.</p>

<p>The kindly, placid woman who will ever be remembered as Charlotte 
Bront&euml;&rsquo;s schoolmistress, had, it may be safely said, no 
history.&nbsp; She was a good-hearted woman, who did her work and went to 
her rest with no possible claim to a place in biography, save only that she
assisted in the education of two great women.&nbsp; For that reason her 
brief story is worth setting forth here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid we cannot give you very much information about our 
aunt, Miss Wooler,&rsquo; writes one of her kindred.&nbsp; &lsquo;She was 
the eldest of a large family, born June 10th, 1792.&nbsp; She was extremely
intelligent and highly educated, and throughout her long life, which lasted
till within a week of completing her ninety-third year, she took the 
greatest interest in religious, political, and every charitable work, being
a life governor to many institutions.&nbsp; Part of her early life was 
spent in the Isle of Wight with relations, where she was very intimate with
the Sewell family, one of whom was the author of <i>Amy Herbert</i>.&nbsp; 
By her own family, she was ever looked up to with the greatest respect, 
being always called &ldquo;Sister&rdquo; by her brothers and sisters all 
her life.&nbsp; After she retired from her school at Roe Head, and 
afterwards Dewsbury Moor, she used sometimes to make her home for months 
together with my father and mother at Heckmondwike Vicarage; then she would
go away for a few months to the sea-side, either alone or with one of her 
sisters.&nbsp; The last ten or twelve years of her life were spent at 
Gomersall, along with two of her sisters and a niece.&nbsp; The three 
sisters all <!-- page 261--><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
261</span>died within a year, the youngest going first and the eldest 
last.&nbsp; They are buried in Birstall Churchyard, close to my parents and
sister.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Bront&euml; was her pupil when at Roe Head; the late Miss 
Taylor and Miss E. Nussey were also her pupils at the same time.&nbsp; 
Afterwards Miss Bront&euml; stayed on as governess.&nbsp; My father 
prepared Miss Bront&euml; for confirmation when he was curate-in-charge at 
Mirfield Parish Church.&nbsp; When Miss Bront&euml; was married, Miss 
Wooler was one of the guests.&nbsp; Mr. Bront&euml;, not feeling well 
enough to go to Church that morning, my aunt gave her away, as she had no 
other relative there to do it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Wooler kept up a warm friendship with her former pupil, up 
to the time of her death.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My aunt was a most loyal subject, and devotedly attached to the 
Church.&nbsp; She made a point of reading the Bible steadily through every 
year, and a chapter out of her Italian Testament each day, for she used to 
say &ldquo;she never liked to lose anything she had learnt.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was always a pleasure, too, if she met with any one who could converse with
her in French.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear these few items will not be of much use, but it is 
difficult to record anything of one who led such a quiet and retiring, but 
useful life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My recollections of Miss Wooler,&rsquo; writes Miss Nussey, 
&lsquo;are, that she was short and stout, but graceful in her movements, 
very fluent in conversation and with a very sweet voice.&nbsp; She had 
Charlotte and myself to stay with her sometimes after we left school.&nbsp;
We had delightful sitting-up times with her when the pupils had gone to 
bed.&nbsp; She would treat us so confidentially, relating her six 
years&rsquo; residence in the Isle of Wight with an uncle and 
aunt&mdash;Dr. More and his wife.&nbsp; Dr. More was on the military staff,
and the society of the island had claims upon him.&nbsp; Mrs. More was a 
fine woman and very benevolent.&nbsp; Personally, Miss Wooler was like a 
lady abbess.&nbsp; She wore white, well-fitting dresses embroidered.&nbsp; 
Her long hair plaited, formed a coronet, and long large ringlets fell from 
her head to shoulders.&nbsp; She was not pretty or handsome, but her quiet 
dignity made her <!-- page 262--><a name="page262"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>presence imposing.&nbsp; She was nobly 
scrupulous and conscientious&mdash;a woman of the greatest 
self-denial.&nbsp; Her income was small.&nbsp; She lived on half of it, and
gave the remainder to charitable objects.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear that Charlotte was very fond of her schoolmistress, although
they had one serious difference during the brief period of her stay at 
Dewsbury Moor with Anne.&nbsp; Anne was home-sick and ill, and Miss Wooler,
with her own robust constitution, found it difficult to understand 
Anne&rsquo;s illness.&nbsp; Charlotte, in arms for her sister, spoke out 
with vehemence, and both the sisters went home soon afterwards. <a 
name="citation262"></a><a href="#footnote262" 
class="citation">[262]</a>&nbsp; Here are a bundle of letters addressed to 
Miss Wooler.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS WOOLER</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>August</i> 28<i>th</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Wooler</span>,&mdash;Since you 
wish to hear from me while you are from home, I will write without further 
delay.&nbsp; It often happens that when we linger at first in answering a 
friend&rsquo;s letter, obstacles occur to retard us to an inexcusably late 
period.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In my last I forgot to answer a question you asked me, and was 
sorry afterwards for the omission; I will begin, therefore, by replying to 
it, though I fear what I can give will now come a little late.&nbsp; You 
said Mrs. Chapham had some thoughts of sending her daughter to school, and 
wished to know whether the Clergy Daughters&rsquo; School at Casterton was 
an eligible place.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My personal knowledge of that institution is very much out of 
date, being derived from the experience of twenty years ago; the 
establishment was at that time in its infancy, and a sad rickety infancy it
was.&nbsp; Typhus fever decimated the school periodically, and consumption 
and scrofula in every variety of form, which bad air and water, and bad, 
insufficient diet can generate, preyed on the ill-fated pupils.&nbsp; It 
would not then have been a fit place for any of Mrs. Chapham&rsquo;s 
children.&nbsp; But, I understand, it is very much altered for the better 
since those <!-- page 263--><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
263</span>days.&nbsp; The school is removed from Cowan Bridge (a situation 
as unhealthy as it was picturesque&mdash;low, damp, beautiful with wood and
water) to Casterton; the accommodation, the diet, the discipline, the 
system of tuition, all are, I believe, entirely altered and greatly 
improved.&nbsp; I was told that such pupils as behaved well and remained at
school till their educations were finished were provided with situations as
governesses if they wish to adopt that vocation, and that much care was 
exercised in the selection; it was added they were also furnished with an 
excellent wardrobe on quitting Casterton.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I have the opportunity of reading <i>The Life of Dr. 
Arnold</i>, I shall not fail to profit thereby; your recommendation makes 
me desirous to see it.&nbsp; Do you remember once speaking with approbation
of a book called <i>Mrs. Leicester&rsquo;s School</i>, which you said you 
had met with, and you wondered by whom it was written?&nbsp; I was reading 
the other day a lately published collection of the <i>Letters of Charles 
Lamb</i>, edited by Serjeant Talfourd, where I found it mentioned that 
<i>Mrs. Leicester&rsquo;s School</i> was the first production of Lamb and 
his sister.&nbsp; These letters are themselves singularly interesting; they
have hitherto been suppressed in all previous collections of Lamb&rsquo;s 
works and relics, on account of the frequent allusions they contain to the 
unhappy malady of Miss Lamb, and a frightful incident which darkened her 
earlier years.&nbsp; She was, it appears, a woman of the sweetest 
disposition, and, in her normal state, of the highest and clearest 
intellect, but afflicted with periodical insanity which came on once a 
year, or oftener.&nbsp; To her parents she was a most tender and dutiful 
daughter, nursing them in their old age, when one was physically and the 
other mentally infirm, with unremitting care, and at the same time toiling 
to add something by needlework to the slender resources of the 
family.&nbsp; A succession of laborious days and sleepless nights brought 
on a frenzy fit, in which she had the miserable misfortune to kill her own 
mother.&nbsp; She was afterwards placed in a madhouse, where she would have
been detained for life, had not her brother Charles promised to devote 
himself to her and take her under his care&mdash;and for her sake renounce 
a project <!-- page 264--><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
264</span>of marriage he then entertained.&nbsp; An instance of abnegation 
of self scarcely, I think, to be paralleled in the annals of the 
&ldquo;coarser sex.&rdquo;&nbsp; They passed their subsequent lives 
together&mdash;models of fraternal affection, and would have been very 
happy but for the dread visitation to which Mary Lamb continued liable all 
her life.&nbsp; I thought it both a sad and edifying history.&nbsp; Your 
account of your little niece&rsquo;s na&iuml;ve delight in beholding the 
morning sea for the first time amused and pleased me; it proves she has 
some sensations&mdash;a refreshing circumstance in a day and generation 
when the natural phenomenon of children wholly destitute of all pretension 
to the same is by no means an unusual occurrence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have written a long letter as you requested me, but I fear you 
will not find it very amusing.&nbsp; With love to your little 
companion,&mdash;Believe me, my dear Miss Wooler, yours affectionately and 
respectfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. 
Bront&euml;</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa, I am most thankful to say, continues in very good health, 
considering his age.&nbsp; My sisters likewise are pretty well.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS WOOLER</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>March</i> 31<i>st</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Wooler</span>,&mdash;I had been 
wishing to hear from you for some time before I received your last.&nbsp; 
There has been so much sickness during the last winter, and the influenza 
especially has been so severe and so generally prevalent, that the sight of
suffering around us has frequently suggested fears for absent 
friends.&nbsp; Ellen Nussey told me, indeed, that neither you nor Miss C. 
Wooler had escaped the influenza, but, since your letter contains no 
allusion to your own health or hers, I trust you are completely 
recovered.&nbsp; I am most thankful to say that papa has hitherto been 
exempted from any attack.&nbsp; My sister and myself have each had a visit 
from it, but Anne is the only one with whom it stayed long or did much 
mischief; in her case it was attended with distressing cough and fever; but
she is now better, though it has left her chest weak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I remember well wishing my lot had been cast in the troubled 
times of the late war, and seeing in its exciting <!-- page 265--><a 
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>incidents a kind of 
stimulating charm which it made my pulse beat fast only to think of&mdash;I
remember even, I think, being a little impatient that you would not fully 
sympathise with my feelings on this subject, that you heard my aspirations 
and speculations very tranquilly, and by no means seemed to think the 
flaming sword could be any pleasant addition to the joys of paradise.&nbsp;
I have now outlived youth; and, though I dare not say that I have outlived 
all its illusions, that the romance is quite gone from life, the veil 
fallen from truth, and that I see both in naked reality, yet, certainly, 
many things are not to me what they were ten years ago; and amongst the 
rest, &ldquo;the pomp and circumstance of war&rdquo; have quite lost in my 
eyes their factitious glitter.&nbsp; I have still no doubt that the shock 
of moral earthquakes wakens a vivid sense of life both in nations and 
individuals; that the fear of dangers on a broad national scale diverts 
men&rsquo;s minds momentarily from brooding over small private perils, and,
for the time, gives them something like largeness of views; but, as little 
doubt have I that convulsive revolutions put back the world in all that is 
good, check civilisation, bring the dregs of society to its 
surface&mdash;in short, it appears to me that insurrections and battles are
the acute diseases of nations, and that their tendency is to exhaust by 
their violence the vital energies of the countries where they occur.&nbsp; 
That England may be spared the spasms, cramps, and frenzy-fits now 
contorting the Continent and threatening Ireland, I earnestly pray!</p>
<p>&lsquo;With the French and Irish I have no sympathy.&nbsp; With the 
Germans and Italians I think the case is different&mdash;as different as 
the love of freedom is from the lust of license.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS WOOLER</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>September</i> 27<i>th</i>, 1850.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Wooler</span>,&mdash;When I tell
you that I have already been to the Lakes this season, and that it is 
scarcely more than a month since I returned, you will understand that it is
no longer within my power to accept your kind invitation.</p>
<p><!-- page 266--><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
266</span>&lsquo;I wish I could have gone to you.&nbsp; I wish your 
invitation had come first; to speak the truth, it would have suited me 
better than the one by which I profited.&nbsp; It would have been pleasant,
soothing, in many ways beneficial, to have spent two weeks with you in your
cottage-lodgings.&nbsp; But these reflections are vain.&nbsp; I have 
already had my excursion, and there is an end of it.&nbsp; Sir J. K. 
Shuttleworth is residing near Windermere, at a house called &ldquo;The 
Briary,&rdquo; and it was there I was staying for a little while in 
August.&nbsp; He very kindly showed me the scenery&mdash;<i>as it can be 
seen from a carriage</i>&mdash;and I discerned that the &ldquo;Lake 
Country&rdquo; is a glorious region, of which I had only seen the 
similitude in dream&mdash;waking or sleeping.&nbsp; But, my dear Miss 
Wooler, I only half enjoyed it, because I was only half at my ease.&nbsp; 
Decidedly I find it does not agree with me to prosecute the search of the 
picturesque in a carriage; a waggon, a spring-cart, even a post-chaise 
might do, but the carriage upsets everything.&nbsp; I longed to slip out 
unseen, and to run away by myself in amongst the hills and dales.&nbsp; 
Erratic and vagrant instincts tormented me, and these I was obliged to 
control, or rather, suppress, for fear of growing in any degree 
enthusiastic, and thus drawing attention to the &ldquo;lioness,&rdquo; the 
authoress, the artist.&nbsp; Sir J. K. Shuttleworth is a man of ability and
intellect, but not a man in whose presence one willingly unbends.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You say you suspect I have found a large circle of acquaintance 
by this time.&nbsp; No, I cannot say that I have.&nbsp; I doubt whether I 
possess either the wish or the power to do so.&nbsp; A few friends I should
like to know well; if such knowledge brought proportionate regard I could 
not help concentrating my feelings.&nbsp; Dissipation, I think, appears 
synonymous with dilution.&nbsp; However, I have as yet scarcely been 
tried.&nbsp; During the month I spent in London in the spring, I kept very 
quiet, having the fear of &ldquo;lionising&rdquo; before my eyes.&nbsp; I 
only went out once to dinner, and was once present at an evening party; and
the only visits I have paid have been to Sir J. K. Shuttleworth and my 
publishers.&nbsp; From this system I should not like to depart.&nbsp; As 
far as I can see, indiscriminate visiting tends only <!-- page 267--><a 
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>to a waste of time 
and a vulgarising of character.&nbsp; Besides, it would be wrong to leave 
papa often; he is now in his 75th year, the infirmities of age begin to 
creep upon him.&nbsp; During the summer he has been much harassed by 
chronic bronchitis, but, I am thankful to say, he is now somewhat 
better.&nbsp; I think my own health has derived benefit from change and 
exercise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ask after Ellen Nussey.&nbsp; When I saw Ellen, about two 
months ago, she looked remarkably well.&nbsp; I sometimes hear small 
fragments of gossip which amuse me.&nbsp; Somebody professes to have 
authority for saying that &ldquo;When Miss Bront&euml; was in London she 
neglected to attend divine service on the Sabbath, and in the week spent 
her time in going about to balls, theatres, and operas.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the
other hand, the London quidnuncs make my seclusion a matter of wonder, and 
devise twenty romantic fictions to account for it.&nbsp; Formerly I used to
listen to report with interest and a certain credulity; I am now grown deaf
and sceptical.&nbsp; Experience has taught me how absolutely devoid of 
foundations her stories may be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With the sincere hope that your own health is better, and kind 
remembrances to all old friends whenever you see them or write to them (and
whether or not their feeling to me has ceased to be friendly, which I fear 
is the case in some instances),&mdash;I am, my dear Miss Wooler, always 
yours, affectionately and respectfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. 
Bront&euml;</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS WOOLER</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>July</i> 14<i>th</i>, 1851.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Wooler</span>,&mdash;My first 
feeling on receiving your note was one of disappointment; but a little 
consideration sufficed to show me that &ldquo;all was for the 
best.&rdquo;&nbsp; In truth, it was a great piece of extravagance on my 
part to ask you and Ellen together; it is much better to divide such good 
things.&nbsp; To have your visit in <i>prospect</i> will console me when 
hers is in <i>retrospect</i>.&nbsp; Not that I mean to yield to the 
weakness of clinging dependently to the society of friends, however dear, 
but still as an occasional treat I must value and even seek such society 
<!-- page 268--><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>as
a necessary of life.&nbsp; Let me know, then, whenever it suits your 
convenience to come to Haworth, and, unless some change I cannot now 
foresee occurs, a ready and warm welcome will await you.&nbsp; Should there
be any cause rendering it desirable to defer the visit, I will tell you 
frankly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The pleasures of society I cannot offer you, nor those of fine 
scenery, but I place very much at your command the moors, some books, a 
series of &ldquo;curling-hair times,&rdquo; and an old pupil into the 
bargain.&nbsp; Ellen may have told you that I have spent a month in London 
this summer.&nbsp; When you come you shall ask what questions you like on 
that point, and I will answer to the best of my stammering ability.&nbsp; 
Do not press me much on the subject of the &ldquo;Crystal 
Palace.&rdquo;&nbsp; I went there five times, and certainly saw some 
interesting things, and the <i>coup d&rsquo;oeil</i> is striking and 
bewildering enough, but I never was able to get up any raptures on the 
subject, and each renewed visit was made under coercion rather than my own 
free-will.&nbsp; It is an excessively bustling place; and, after all, 
it&rsquo;s wonders appeal too exclusively to the eye and rarely touch the 
heart or head.&nbsp; I make an exception to the last assertion in favour of
those who possess a large range of scientific knowledge.&nbsp; Once I went 
with Sir David Brewster, and perceived that he looked on objects with other
eyes than mine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ellen I find is writing, and will therefore deliver her own 
messages of regard.&nbsp; If papa were in the room he would, I know, desire
his respects; and you must take both respects and a good bundle of 
something more cordial from yours very faithfully,</p>

have had you more or less in my thoughts, and wondered how your mother was 
getting on; let me have a line of information as soon as possible.&nbsp; I 
have been busy, first with a somewhat unexpected visitor, a cousin from 
Cornwall, who has been spending a few days with us, and now with Miss 
Wooler, who came on Monday.&nbsp; The former personage we can discuss any 
time when we meet.&nbsp; Miss Wooler is and has been very pleasant.&nbsp; 
She is like good wine: I think time improves her; and really whatever she 
may be in person, in mind she is younger than when at Roe Head.&nbsp; Papa 
and she get on extremely well.&nbsp; I have just heard papa walk into the 
dining-room and pay her a round compliment on her good-sense.&nbsp; I think
so far she has been pretty comfortable and likes Haworth, but as she only 
brought a small hand-basket of luggage with her she cannot stay long.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS WOOLER</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>February</i> 6<i>th</i>, 1852.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ellen Nussey, it seems, told you I spent a fortnight in London 
last December; they wished me very much to stay a month, alleging that I 
should in that time be able to secure a complete circle of acquaintance, 
but I found a fortnight of such excitement quite enough.&nbsp; The whole 
day was usually spent in sight-seeing, and often the evening was spent in 
society; it was more than I could bear for a length of time.&nbsp; On one 
occasion I met a party of my critics&mdash;seven of them; some of them had 
been very bitter foes in print, but they were prodigiously civil face to 
face.&nbsp; These gentlemen seemed infinitely <!-- page 270--><a 
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>grander, more 
pompous, dashing, showy, than the few authors I saw.&nbsp; Mr. Thackeray, 
for instance, is a man of quiet, simple demeanour; he is however looked 
upon with some awe and even distrust.&nbsp; His conversation is very 
peculiar, too perverse to be pleasant.&nbsp; It was proposed to me to see 
Charles Dickens, Lady Morgan, Mesdames Trollope, Gore, and some others, but
I was aware these introductions would bring a degree of notoriety I was not
disposed to encounter; I declined, therefore, with thanks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing charmed me more during my stay in town than the pictures 
I saw.&nbsp; One or two private collections of Turner&rsquo;s best 
water-colour drawings were indeed a treat; his later oil-paintings are 
strange things&mdash;things that baffle description.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I twice saw Macready act&mdash;once in <i>Macbeth</i> and once in
<i>Othello</i>.&nbsp; I astonished a dinner-party by honestly saying I did 
not like him.&nbsp; It is the fashion to rave about his splendid 
acting.&nbsp; Anything more false and artificial, less genuinely impressive
than his whole style I could scarcely have imagined.&nbsp; The fact is, the
stage-system altogether is hollow nonsense.&nbsp; They act farces well 
enough: the actors comprehend their parts and do them justice.&nbsp; They 
comprehend nothing about tragedy or Shakespeare, and it is a failure.&nbsp;
I said so; and by so saying produced a blank silence&mdash;a mute 
consternation.&nbsp; I was, indeed, obliged to dissent on many occasions, 
and to offend by dissenting.&nbsp; It seems now very much the custom to 
admire a certain wordy, intricate, obscure style of poetry, such as 
Elizabeth Barrett Browning writes.&nbsp; Some pieces were referred to about
which Currer Bell was expected to be very rapturous, and failing in this, 
he disappointed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;London people strike a provincial as being very much taken up 
with little matters about which no one out of particular town-circles cares
much; they talk, too, of persons&mdash;literary men and women&mdash;whose 
names are scarcely heard in the country, and in whom you cannot get up an 
interest.&nbsp; I think I should scarcely like to live in London, and were 
I obliged to live there, I should certainly go little into company, 
especially I should eschew the literary coteries.</p>
<p><!-- page 271--><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<i>March</i> 12<i>th</i>, 1852.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Wooler</span>,&mdash;Your kind 
note holds out a strong temptation, but one that <i>must be 
resisted</i>.&nbsp; From home I must not go unless health or some cause 
equally imperative render a change necessary.&nbsp; For nearly four months 
now (<i>i.e.</i> since I became ill) I have not put pen to paper.&nbsp; My 
work has been lying untouched, and my faculties have been rusting for want 
of exercise.&nbsp; Further relaxation is out of the question, and I <i>will
not permit myself to think of it</i>.&nbsp; My publisher groans over my 
long delays; I am sometimes provoked to check the expression of his 
impatience with short and crusty answers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet the pleasure I now deny myself I would fain regard as only 
deferred.&nbsp; I heard something about your proposing to visit 
Scarbro&rsquo; in the course of the summer, and could I by the close of 
July or August bring my task to a certain point, how glad should I be to 
join you there for awhile!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ellen will probably go to the south about May to make a stay of 
two or three months; she has formed a plan for my accompanying her and 
taking lodgings on the Sussex Coast; but the scheme seems to me 
impracticable for many reasons, and, moreover, my medical man doubts the 
advisability of my going southward in summer, he says it might prove very 
enervating, whereas Scarbro&rsquo; or Burlington would brace and 
strengthen.&nbsp; However, I dare not lay plans at this distance of 
time.&nbsp; For me so much must depend, first on papa&rsquo;s health (which
throughout the winter has been, I am thankful to say, really excellent), 
and second, on the progress of work, a matter not wholly contingent on wish
or will, but lying in a great measure beyond the reach of effort and out of
the pale of calculation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not write more at present, as I wish to save this 
post.&nbsp; All in the house would join in kind remembrances to you if they
knew I was writing.&nbsp; Tabby and Martha both frequently <!-- page 
272--><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>inquire 
after Miss Wooler, and desire their respects when an opportunity offers of 
presenting the same.&mdash;Believe me, yours always affectionately and

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>September</i> 2<i>nd</i>, 1852.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Wooler</span>,&mdash;I have 
delayed answering your very kind letter till I could speak decidedly 
respecting papa&rsquo;s health.&nbsp; For some weeks after the attack there
were frequent variations, and once a threatening of a relapse, but I trust 
his convalescence may now be regarded as confirmed.&nbsp; The acute 
inflammation of the eye, which distressed papa so much as threatening loss 
of sight, but which I suppose was merely symptomatic of the rush of blood 
to the brain, is now quite subsided; the partial paralysis has also 
disappeared; the appetite is better; weakness with occasional slight 
giddiness seem now the only lingering traces of disease.&nbsp; I am assured
that with papa&rsquo;s excellent constitution, there is every prospect of 
his still being spared to me for many years.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For two things I have reason to be most thankful, viz., that the 
mental faculties have remained quite untouched, and also that my own health
and strength have been found sufficient for the occasion.&nbsp; Solitary as
I certainly was at Filey, I yet derived great benefit from the change.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be pleasant at the sea-side this fine warm weather, and 
I should dearly like to be there with you; to such a treat, however, I do 
not now look forward at all.&nbsp; You will fully understand the 
impossibility of my enjoying peace of mind during absence from papa under 
present circumstances; his strength must be very much more fully restored 
before I can think of leaving home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Miss Wooler, in case you should go to Scarbro&rsquo; this
season, may I request you to pay one visit to the churchyard and see if the
inscription on the stone has been altered as I directed.&nbsp; We have 
heard nothing since on the subject, and I fear the alteration may have been
neglected.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ellen has made a long stay in the south, but I believe she <!--

<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS WOOLER</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>September</i> 21<i>st</i>, 1852.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Wooler</span>,&mdash;I was truly
sorry to hear that when Ellen called at the Parsonage you were suffering 
from influenza.&nbsp; I know that an attack of this debilitating complaint 
is no trifle in your case, as its effects linger with you long.&nbsp; It 
has been very prevalent in this neighbourhood.&nbsp; I did not escape, but 
the sickness and fever only lasted a few days and the cough was not 
severe.&nbsp; Papa, I am thankful to say, continues pretty well; Ellen 
thinks him little, if at all altered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now for your kind present.&nbsp; The book will be precious to
me&mdash;chiefly, perhaps, for the sake of the giver, but also for its own 
sake, for it is a good book; and I wish I may be enabled to read it with 
some approach to the spirit you would desire.&nbsp; Its perusal came 
recommended in such a manner as to obviate danger of neglect; its place 
shall always be on my dressing-table.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to the other part of the present, it arrived under these 
circumstances:</p>
<p>&lsquo;For a month past an urgent necessity to buy and make some things 
for winter-wear had been importuning my conscience; the <i>buying</i> might
be soon effected, but the <i>making</i> was a more serious 
consideration.&nbsp; At this juncture Ellen arrives with a good-sized 
parcel, which, when opened, discloses the things I required, perfectly made
and of capital useful fabric; adorned too&mdash;which seemly decoration it 
is but too probable I might myself have foregone as an augmentation of 
trouble not to be lightly incurred.&nbsp; I felt strong doubts as to my 
right to profit by this sort of fairy gift, so unlooked for and so 
curiously opportune; on reading the note accompanying the garments, I am 
told that to accept will be to confer a favour(!)&nbsp; <!-- page 274--><a 
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>The doctrine is too 
palatable to be rejected; I even waive all nice scrutiny of its 
soundness&mdash;in short, I submit with as good a grace as may be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ellen has only been my companion one little week.&nbsp; I would 
not have her any longer, for I am disgusted with myself and my delays, and 
consider it was a weak yielding to temptation in me to send for her at all;
but, in truth, my spirits were getting low&mdash;prostrate sometimes, and 
she has done me inexpressible good.&nbsp; I wonder when I shall see you at 
Haworth again.&nbsp; Both my father and the servants have again and again 
insinuated a distinct wish that you should be requested to come in the 
course of the summer and autumn, but I always turned a deaf ear: &ldquo;Not
yet,&rdquo; was my thought, &ldquo;I want first to be free&mdash;work 
first, then pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I venture to send by Ellen a book which may amuse an hour: a 
Scotch tale by a minister&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; It seems to me well told, and
may serve to remind you of characters and manners you have seen in 
Scotland.&nbsp; When you have time to write a line, I shall feel anxious to
hear how you are.&nbsp; With kind regards to all old friends, and truest 
affection to yourself; in which Ellen joins me,&mdash;I am, my dear Miss 
Wooler, yours gratefully and respectfully,</p>

<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS WOOLER</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>October</i> 8<i>th</i>, 1852.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Wooler</span>,&mdash;I wished 
much to write to you immediately on my return home, but I found several 
little matters demanding attention, and have been kept busy till now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I reached home about five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and the
anxiety which is inseparable from a return after absence was pleasantly 
relieved by finding papa well and cheerful.&nbsp; He inquired after you 
with interest.&nbsp; I gave him your kind regards, and he specially charged
me whenever I wrote to present his in return, and to say also that he hoped
to see you at Haworth at the earliest date which shall be convenient to 
you.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The week I spent at Hornsea was a happy and pleasant <!-- page 
275--><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>week.&nbsp; 
Thank you, my dear Miss Wooler, for the true kindness which gave it its 
chief charm.&nbsp; I shall think of you often, especially when I walk out, 
and during the long evenings.&nbsp; I believe the weather has at length 
taken a turn: to-day is beautifully fine.&nbsp; I wish I were at Hornsea 
and just now preparing to go out with you to walk on the sands or along the
lake.</p>
<p>I would not have you to fatigue yourself with writing to me when you are
not inclined, but yet I should be glad to hear from you some day ere 
long.&nbsp; When you <i>do</i> write, tell me how you liked <i>The 
Experience of Life</i>, and whether you have read <i>Esmond</i>, and what 
you think of it.&mdash;Believe me always yours, with true affection and 
respect,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. 
Bront&euml;</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS WOOLER</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Brookroyd</span>, 
<i>December</i> 7<i>th</i>, 1852.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Wooler</span>,&mdash;Since you 
were so kind as to take some interest in my small tribulation of Saturday, 
I write a line to tell you that on Sunday morning a letter came which put 
me out of pain and obviated the necessity of an impromptu journey to 
London.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The <i>money transaction</i>, of course, remains the same, and 
perhaps is not quite equitable; but when an author finds that his work is 
cordially approved, he can pardon the rest&mdash;indeed, my chief regret 
now lies in the conviction that papa will be disappointed: he expected me 
to earn &pound;500, nor did I myself anticipate that a lower sum would be 
offered; however, &pound;250 is not to be despised. <a 
name="citation275"></a><a href="#footnote275" 
class="citation">[275]</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;Your sudden departure from Brookroyd left a legacy of 
consternation to the bereaved breakfast-table.&nbsp; Ellen was not easily 
to be soothed, though I diligently represented to her that you had quitted 
Haworth with the same inexorable haste.&nbsp; I am commissioned to tell 
you, first, that she has decided not to go to Yarmouth till after 
Christmas, her mother&rsquo;s health having within the last few days 
betrayed some symptoms not <!-- page 276--><a name="page276"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>unlike those which preceded her former 
illness; and though it is to be hoped that those may pass without any 
untoward result, yet they naturally increase Ellen&rsquo;s reluctance to 
leave home for the present.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Secondly, I am to say, that when the present you left came to be 
examined, the costliness and beauty of it inspired some concern.&nbsp; 
Ellen thinks you are too kind, as I also think every morning, for I am now 
benefiting by your kind gift.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With sincere regards to all at the Parsonage,&mdash;I am, my dear
Miss Wooler, yours respectfully and affectionately,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. 
Bront&euml;</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I shall direct that <i>Esmond</i> (Mr. 
Thackeray&rsquo;s work) shall be sent on to you as soon as the Hunsworth 
party have read it.&nbsp; It has already reached a second 
edition.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS WOOLER</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>January</i> 20<i>th</i>, 1853.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Wooler</span>,&mdash;Your last 
kind note would not have remained so long unanswered if I had been in 
better health.&nbsp; While Ellen was with me, I seemed to revive 
wonderfully, but began to grow worse again the day she left; and this 
falling off proved symptomatic of a relapse.&nbsp; My doctor called the 
next day; he said the headache from which I was suffering arose from 
inertness in the liver.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank God, I now feel better; and very grateful am I for the 
improvement&mdash;grateful no less for my dear father&rsquo;s sake than for
my own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most fully can I sympathise with you in the anxiety you express 
about your friend.&nbsp; The thought of his leaving England and going out 
alone to a strange country, with all his natural sensitiveness and retiring
diffidence, is indeed painful; still, my dear Miss Wooler, should he 
actually go to America, I can but then suggest to you the same source of 
comfort and support you have suggested to me, and of which indeed I know 
you never lose sight&mdash;namely, reliance on Providence.&nbsp; &ldquo;God
tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,&rdquo; and He will doubtless <!-- page 
277--><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>care for a 
good, though afflicted man, amidst whatever difficulties he may be 
thrown.&nbsp; When you write again, I should be glad to know whether your 
anxiety on this subject is relieved.&nbsp; I was truly glad to learn 
through Ellen that Ilkley still continued to agree with your health.&nbsp; 
Earnestly trusting that the New Year may prove to you a happy and tranquil 
time,&mdash;I am, my dear Miss Wooler, sincerely and affectionately 
yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C.

<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS WOOLER</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>January</i> 27<i>th</i>, 1853.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Wooler</span>,&mdash;I received 
your letter here in London where I have been staying about three weeks, and
shall probably remain a few days longer.&nbsp; <i>Villette</i> is to be 
published to-morrow.&nbsp; Its appearance has been purposely delayed 
hitherto, to avoid discourteous clashing with Mrs. Gaskell&rsquo;s new 
work.&nbsp; Your name was one of the first on the list of presentees, and 
directed to the Parsonage, where I shall also send this letter, as you 
mention that you are to leave Halifax at the close of this week.&nbsp; I 
will bear in mind what you say about Mrs. Morgan; and should I ever have an
opportunity of serving her, will not omit to do so.&nbsp; I only wish my 
chance of being useful were greater.&nbsp; Schools seem to be considered 
almost obsolete in London.&nbsp; Ladies&rsquo; colleges, with professors 
for every branch of instruction, are superseding the old-fashioned 
seminary.&nbsp; How the system will work I can&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp; I think 
the college classes might be very useful for finishing the education of 
ladies intended to go out as governesses, but what progress little girls 
will make in them seems to me another question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Miss Wooler, I read attentively all you say about Miss 
Martineau; the sincerity and constancy of your solicitude touches me very 
much.&nbsp; I should grieve to neglect or oppose your advice, and yet I do 
not feel that it would be right to give Miss Martineau up entirely.&nbsp; 
There is in her nature much that is very noble.&nbsp; Hundreds have 
forsaken her, more, I fear, in the apprehension that their fair names may 
suffer if seen in connection with hers, than from any pure convictions, 
such <!-- page 278--><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
278</span>as you suggest, of harm consequent on her fatal tenets.&nbsp; 
With these fair-weather friends I cannot bear to rank.&nbsp; And for her 
sin, is it not one of those which God and not man must judge?</p>
<p>&lsquo;To speak the truth, my dear Miss Wooler, I believe if you were in
my place, and knew Miss Martineau as I do&mdash;if you had shared with me 
the proofs of her rough but genuine kindliness, and had seen how she 
secretly suffers from abandonment, you would be the last to give her up; 
you would separate the sinner from the sin, and feel as if the right lay 
rather in quietly adhering to her in her strait, while that adherence is 
unfashionable and unpopular, than in turning on her your back when the 
world sets the example.&nbsp; I believe she is one of those whom opposition
and desertion make obstinate in error, while patience and tolerance touch 
her deeply and keenly, and incline her to ask of her own heart whether the 
course she has been pursuing may not possibly be a faulty course.&nbsp; 
However, I have time to think of this subject, and I shall think of it 
seriously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to what I have seen in London during my present visit, I hope 
one day to tell you all about it by our fireside at home.&nbsp; When you 
write again will you name a time when it would suit you to come and see me;
everybody in the house would be glad of your presence; your last visit is 
pleasantly remembered by all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With kindest regards,&mdash;I am always, affectionately and 
respectfully yours,</p>

<p>A note to Miss Nussey written after Charlotte&rsquo;s death indicates a 
fairly shrewd view on the part of Miss Wooler as regards the popularity of 
her friend.</p>

280</span>CHAPTER XI: THE CURATES AT HAWORTH</h2>
<p>Something has already been said concerning the growth of the population 
of Haworth during the period of Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s Incumbency.&nbsp; 
It was 4668 in 1821, and 6301 in 1841.&nbsp; This makes it natural that Mr.
Bront&euml; should have applied to his Bishop for assistance in his 
pastoral duty, and such aid was permanently granted him in 1838, when Mr. 
William Weightman became his first curate. <a name="citation280"></a><a 
href="#footnote280" class="citation">[280]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Weightman would 
appear to have been a favourite.&nbsp; He many times put in an appearance 
at the parsonage, although I do not recognise him in any one of 
Charlotte&rsquo;s novels, and he certainly has no place among the three 
famous curates of <i>Shirley</i>.&nbsp; He would seem to have been the only
man, other than her father and brother, whom Emily was known to 
tolerate.&nbsp; We know that the girls considered him effeminate, and they 
called him &lsquo;Celia Amelia,&rsquo; under which name he frequently 
appears in Charlotte&rsquo;s letters to Ellen Nussey.&nbsp; That he was 
good-natured seems to be indisputable.&nbsp; There is one story of his 
walking to Bradford to post valentines to the incumbent&rsquo;s daughters, 
when he found they had never received any.&nbsp; There is another story of 
a trip to Keighley to hear him lecture.&nbsp; He was a bit of a poet, it 
seems, and Ellen Nussey was the heroine of some of his verses when she <!--
page 281--><a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>visited
at Haworth.&nbsp; Here is a letter which throws some light upon 
Charlotte&rsquo;s estimate of the young man&mdash;he was twenty-three years
of age at this time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>March</i> 17<i>th</i>, 1840.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Eleanor</span>,&mdash;I wish to 
scold you with a forty-horse power for having told Mary Taylor that I had 
requested you not to tell her everything, which piece of information has 
thrown her into tremendous ill-humour, besides setting the teeth of her 
curiosity on edge.&nbsp; Tell her forthwith every individual occurrence, 
including valentines, &ldquo;Fair E---, Fair E---,&rdquo; etc.; &ldquo;Away
fond love,&rdquo; etc.; &ldquo;Soul divine,&rdquo; and all; likewise the 
painting of Miss Celia Amelia Weightman&rsquo;s portrait, and that <i>young
lady&rsquo;s</i> frequent and agreeable visits.&nbsp; By-the-bye, I 
inquired into the opinion of that intelligent and interesting young person 
respecting you.&nbsp; It was a favourable one.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rdquo; 
thought you a fine-looking girl, and a very good girl into the 
bargain.&nbsp; Have you received the newspaper which has been despatched, 
containing a notice of &ldquo;her&rdquo; lecture at Keighley?&nbsp; Mr. 
Morgan came and stayed three days.&nbsp; By Miss Weightman&rsquo;s aid, we 
got on pretty well.&nbsp; It was amazing to see with what patience and 
good-temper the innocent creature endured that fat Welshman&rsquo;s 
prosing, though she confessed afterwards that she was almost done up by his
long stories.&nbsp; We feel very dull without you.&nbsp; I wish those three
weeks were to come over again.&nbsp; Aunt has been at times precious cross 
since you went&mdash;however, she is rather better now.&nbsp; I had a bad 
cold on Sunday and stayed at home most of the day.&nbsp; Anne&rsquo;s cold 
is better, but I don&rsquo;t consider her strong yet.&nbsp; What did your 
sister Anne say about my omitting to send a drawing for the Jew 
basket?&nbsp; I hope she was too much occupied with the thoughts of going 
to Earnley to think of it.&nbsp; I am obliged to cut short my letter.&nbsp;
Everybody in the house unites in sending their love to you.&nbsp; Miss 
Celia Amelia Weightman also desires to be remembered.&nbsp; Write soon 
again and&mdash;Believe me, yours unalterably,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span

<p>He would seem to have been a much teased curate.&nbsp; Now <!-- page 
282--><a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>it is Miss 
Ellen Nussey, now a Miss Agnes Walton, who is supposed to be the object of 
his devotion.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Mrs. Menelaus</span>,&mdash;I think I
am exceedingly good to write to you so soon, indeed I am quite afraid you 
will begin to consider me intrusive with my frequent letters.&nbsp; I ought
by right to let an interval of a quarter of a year elapse between each 
communication, and I will, in time; never fear me.&nbsp; I shall improve in
procrastination as I get older.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My hand is trembling like that of an old man, so I don&rsquo;t 
expect you will be able to read my writing; never mind, put the letter by 
and I&rsquo;ll read it to you the next time I see you.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been painting a portrait of Agnes Walton for our friend 
Miss Celia Amelia.&nbsp; You would laugh to see how his eyes sparkle with 
delight when he looks at it, like a pretty child pleased with a new 
plaything.&nbsp; Good-bye to you.&nbsp; Let me have no more of your humbug

he was gone to pass his examination at Ripon six weeks ago.&nbsp; He is not
come back yet, and what has become of him we don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; 
Branwell has received one letter since he went, speaking rapturously of 
Agnes Walton, describing certain balls at which he had figured, and 
announcing that he had been twice over head and ears desperately in 
love.&nbsp; It is my devout belief that his reverence left Haworth with the
fixed intention of never returning.&nbsp; If he does return, it will be 
because he has not been able to get a &ldquo;living.&rdquo;&nbsp; Haworth 
is not the place <!-- page 283--><a name="page283"></a><span

of faces, difficulties to be overcome.&nbsp; He pleases so easily that he 
soon gets weary of pleasing at all.&nbsp; He ought not to have been a 
parson; certainly he ought not.&nbsp; Our <i>august</i> relations, as you 
choose to call them, are gone back to London.&nbsp; They never stayed with 
us, they only spent one day at our house.&nbsp; Have you seen anything of 
the Miss Woolers lately?&nbsp; I wish they, or somebody else, would get me

<p>One wonders if a single letter by Charlotte Bront&euml; applying for a 
&lsquo;situation&rsquo; has been preserved!&nbsp; I have not seen one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>September</i> 29<i>th</i>, 1840.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know Mrs. Ellen is burning with eagerness to hear something 
about William Weightman.&nbsp; I think I&rsquo;ll plague her by not telling
her a word.&nbsp; To speak heaven&rsquo;s truth, I have precious little to 
say, inasmuch as I seldom see him, except on a Sunday, when he looks as 
handsome, cheery, and good-tempered as usual.&nbsp; I have indeed had the 
advantage of one long conversation since his return from Westmorland, when 
he poured out his whole warm fickle soul in fondness and admiration of 
Agnes Walton.&nbsp; Whether he is in love with her or not I can&rsquo;t 
say; I can only observe that it sounds very like it.&nbsp; He sent us a 
prodigious quantity of game while he was away&mdash;a brace of wild ducks, 
a brace of black grouse, a brace of partridges, ditto of snipes, ditto of 
curlews, and a large salmon.&nbsp; If you were to ask Mr. Weightman&rsquo;s
opinion of my character just now, he would say that at first he thought me 
a cheerful chatty kind of body, but that on farther acquaintance he found 
me of a capricious changeful temper, never to be reckoned on.&nbsp; He does
not know that I have regulated my manner by his&mdash;that I was cheerful 
and chatty so long as he was respectful, and that when he grew almost 
contemptuously familiar I found it necessary to adopt a <!-- page 284--><a 
name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>degree of reserve 
which was not natural, and therefore was very painful to me.&nbsp; I find 
this reserve very convenient, and consequently I intend to keep it 
up.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>November</i> 12<i>th</i>, 1840.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Nell</span>,&mdash;You will excuse 
this scrawled sheet of paper, inasmuch as I happen to be out of that 
article, this being the only available sheet I can find in my desk.&nbsp; I
have effaced one of the delectable portraitures, but have spared the 
others&mdash;lead pencil sketches of horse&rsquo;s head, and man&rsquo;s 
head&mdash;being moved to that act of clemency by the recollection that 
they are not the work of my hand, but of the sacred fingers of his 
reverence William Weightman.&nbsp; You will discern that the eye is a 
little too elevated in the horse&rsquo;s head, otherwise I can assure you 
it is no such bad attempt.&nbsp; It shows taste and something of an 
artist&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; The fellow had no copy for it.&nbsp; He sketched 
it, and one or two other little things, when he happened to be here one 
evening, but you should have seen the vanity with which he afterwards 
regarded his productions.&nbsp; One of them represented the flying figure 
of Fame inscribing his own name on the clouds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Brook and I have interchanged letters.&nbsp; She expressed 
herself pleased with the style of my application&mdash;with its candour, 
etc.&nbsp; (I took care to tell her that if she wanted a showy, elegant, 
fashionable personage, I was not the man for her), but she wants music and 
singing.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t give her music and singing, so of course the 
negotiation is null and void.&nbsp; Being once up, however, I don&rsquo;t 
mean to sit down till I have got what I want; but there is no sense in 
talking about unfinished projects, so we&rsquo;ll drop the subject.&nbsp; 
Consider this last sentence a hint from me to be applied practically.&nbsp;
It seems Miss Wooler&rsquo;s school is in a consumptive state of 
health.&nbsp; I have been endeavouring to obtain a reinforcement of pupils 
for her, but I cannot succeed, because Mrs. Heap is opening a new school in
Bradford.</p>

particular, but to half a dozen other ladies.&nbsp; He has just cut his 
<i>inamorata</i> at Swansea, and sent her back all her letters.&nbsp; His 
present object of devotion is Caroline Dury, to whom he has just despatched
a most passionate copy of verses.&nbsp; Poor lad, his sanguine temperament 
bothers him grievously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That Swansea affair seems to me somewhat heartless as far as I 
can understand it, though I have not heard a very clear explanation.&nbsp; 
He sighs as much as ever.&nbsp; I have not mentioned your name to him yet, 
nor do I mean to do so until I have a fair opportunity of gathering his 
real mind.&nbsp; Perhaps I may never mention it at all, but on the contrary
carefully avoid all allusion to you.&nbsp; It will just depend upon the 
further opinion I may form of his character.&nbsp; I am not pleased to find
that he was carrying on a regular correspondence with this lady at Swansea 
all the time he was paying such pointed attention to you; and now the 
abrupt way in which he has cut her off, and the evident wandering 
instability of his mind is no favourable symptom at all.&nbsp; I shall not 
have many opportunities of observing him for a month to come.&nbsp; As for 
the next fortnight, he will be sedulously engaged in preparing for his 
ordination, and the fortnight after he will spend at Appleby and 
Crackenthorp with Mr. and Miss Walton.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t think about him; I
am not afraid you will break your heart, but don&rsquo;t think about 
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give my love to Mercy and your mother, and,&mdash;Believe me, 
yours sincerely,</p>

have received a valentine this year from our bonny-faced friend the curate 
of Haworth.&nbsp; I got a precious specimen a few days before I left home,

honour and admire his generous, open disposition, and sweet 
temper&mdash;but for all the tricks, wiles, and insincerities of love, the

persuade every woman under thirty whom he sees that he is desperately in 
love with her.&nbsp; I have a great deal more to say, but I have not a

</blockquote>
<p>During the governess and Brussels episodes in Charlotte&rsquo;s life we 
lose sight of Mr. Weightman, and the next record is of his death, which 
took place in September 1842, while Charlotte and Emily were in 
Brussels.&nbsp; Mr. Bront&euml; preached the funeral sermon, <a 
name="citation287"></a><a href="#footnote287" class="citation">[287]</a> 
stating by way of introduction that for the twenty years and more that he 
had been in Haworth he had never before read his sermon.&nbsp; &lsquo;This 
is owing to a conviction in my mind,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;that in 
general, for the ordinary run of hearers, extempore preaching, though 
accompanied with some peculiar disadvantages, is more likely to be of a 
colloquial nature, and better adapted, on the whole, to the 
majority.&rsquo;&nbsp; His departure from the practice on this occasion, he
explains, is due to the request that his sermon should be printed.</p>
<p>Mr. Weightman, he told his hearers, was a native of Westmoreland, 
educated at the University of Durham.&nbsp; &lsquo;While he was 
there,&rsquo; continued Mr. Bront&euml;, &lsquo;I applied to the justly 
venerated Apostolical Bishop of this diocese, requesting his Lordship to 
send me a curate adequate to the wants and wishes of the 
parishioners.&nbsp; This application was not in vain.&nbsp; Our Diocesan, 
in the scriptural <!-- page 288--><a name="page288"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 288</span>character of the Overlooker and Head of his 
clergy, made an admirable choice, which more than answered my expectations,
and probably yours.&nbsp; The Church Pastoral Aid Society, in their pious 
liberality, lent their pecuniary aid, without which all efforts must have 
failed.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He had classical attainments of the first 
order, and, above all, his religious principles were sound and 
orthodox,&rsquo; concludes Mr. Bront&euml;.&nbsp; Mr. Weightman was 
twenty-six years of age when he died.&nbsp; His successor was Mr. Peter 
Augustus Smith, whom Charlotte Bront&euml; has made famous in 
<i>Shirley</i> as Mr. Malone, curate of Briarfield.&nbsp; Mr. Smith was Mr.
A. B. Nicholls&rsquo;s predecessor at Haworth.&nbsp; Here is Charlotte 
Bront&euml;&rsquo;s vigorous treatment of him in a letter to her 
friend.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>January</i> 26<i>th</i>, 1844.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Nell</span>,&mdash;We were all very glad
to get your letter this morning.&nbsp; <i>We</i>, I say, as both papa and 
Emily were anxious to hear of the safe arrival of yourself and the little 
<i>varmint</i>. <a name="citation288"></a><a href="#footnote288" 
class="citation">[288]</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;As you conjecture, Emily and I set to shirt-making the very day 
after you left, and we have stuck to it pretty closely ever since.&nbsp; We
miss your society at least as much as you miss ours, depend upon it.&nbsp; 
Would that you were within calling distance, that you could as you say 
burst in upon us in an afternoon, and, being despoiled of your bonnet and 
shawl, be fixed in the rocking-chair for the evening once or twice every 
week.&nbsp; I certainly cherished a dream during your stay that such might 
one day be the case, but the dream is somewhat dissipating.&nbsp; I allude 
of course to Mr. Smith, to whom you do not allude in your letter, and I 
think you foolish for the omission.&nbsp; I say the dream is dissipating, 
because Mr. Smith has not mentioned your name since you left, except once 
when papa said you were a nice girl, he said, &ldquo;Yes, she is a nice 
girl&mdash;rather quiet.&nbsp; I suppose she has money,&rdquo; and that is 
all.&nbsp; I think the words <!-- page 289--><a name="page289"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 289</span>speak volumes; they do not prejudice one in 
favour of Mr. Smith.&nbsp; I can well believe what papa has often affirmed,
and continues to affirm, <i>i.e.</i>, that Mr. Smith is a very fickle man, 
that if he marries he will soon get tired of his wife, and consider her as 
a burden, also that money will be a principal consideration with him in 
marrying.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa has two or three times expressed a fear that since Mr. Smith
paid you so much attention he will perhaps have made an impression on your 
mind which will interfere with your comfort.&nbsp; I tell him I think not, 
as I believe you to be mistress of yourself in those matters.&nbsp; Still, 
he keeps saying that I am to write to you and dissuade you from thinking of
him.&nbsp; I never saw papa make himself so uneasy about a thing of the 
kind before; he is usually very sarcastic on such subjects.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Smith be hanged!&nbsp; I never thought very well of him, and 
I am much disposed to think very ill of him at this blessed minute.&nbsp; I
have discussed the subject fully, for where is the use of being mysterious 
and constrained?&mdash;it is not worth while.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be sure you write to me and immediately, and tell me whether you 
have given up eating and drinking altogether.&nbsp; I am not surprised at 
people thinking you looked pale and thin.&nbsp; I shall expect another 
letter on Thursday&mdash;don&rsquo;t disappoint me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My best regards to your mother and sisters.&mdash;Yours, somewhat
irritated,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;C. B.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Nell</span>,&mdash;I did not 
&ldquo;swear at the postman&rdquo; when I saw another letter from 
you.&nbsp; And I hope you will not &ldquo;swear&rdquo; at me when I tell 
you that I cannot think of leaving home at present, even to have the 
pleasure of joining you at Harrogate, but I am obliged to you for thinking 
of me.&nbsp; I have nothing new about Rev. Lothario Smith.&nbsp; I think I 
like him a little bit less every day.&nbsp; Mr. Weightman was worth 200 Mr.
Smiths tied in a bunch.&nbsp; Good-bye.&nbsp; I fear by what you say, 
&ldquo;Flossy jun.&rdquo; behaves discreditably, and gets his mistress into
scrapes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I received your kind
note last Saturday, and should have answered it immediately, but in the 
meantime I had a letter from Mary Taylor, and had to reply to her, and to 
write sundry letters to Brussels to send by opportunity.&nbsp; My sight 
will not allow me to write several letters per day, so I was obliged to do 
it gradually.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I send you two more circulars because you ask for them, not 
because I hope their distribution will produce any result.&nbsp; I hope 
that if a time should come when Emily, Anne, or I shall be able to serve 
you, we shall not forget that you have done your best to serve us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Smith is gone hence.&nbsp; He is in Ireland at present, and 
will stay there six weeks.&nbsp; He has left neither a bad nor a good 
character behind him.&nbsp; Nobody regrets him, because nobody could attach
themselves to one who could attach himself to nobody.&nbsp; I thought once 
he had a regard for you, but I do not think so now.&nbsp; He has never 
asked after you since you left, nor even mentioned you in my hearing, 
except to say once when I purposely alluded to you, that you were 
&ldquo;not very locomotive.&rdquo;&nbsp; The meaning of the observation I 
leave you to divine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet the man is not without points that will be most useful to 
himself in getting through life.&nbsp; His good qualities, however, are all
of the selfish order, but they will make him respected where better and 
more generous natures would be despised, or at least neglected.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Grant fills his shoes at present decently enough&mdash;but 
one cares naught about these sort of individuals, so drop them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mary Taylor is going to leave our hemisphere.&nbsp; To me it is 
something as if a great planet fell out of the sky.&nbsp; Yet, unless she 
marries in New Zealand, she will not stay there long.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Write to me again soon and I promise to write you a regular long 
letter next time.</p>

<p>The Mr. Grant here described had come to Haworth as master of the small 
grammar school in which Branwell had <!-- page 291--><a 
name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>received some portion
of his education.&nbsp; He is the Mr. Donne, curate of Whinbury, in 
<i>Shirley</i>.&nbsp; Whinbury is Oxenhope, of which village and district 
Mr. Grant after a time became incumbent.&nbsp; The district was taken out 
of Haworth Chapelry, and Mr. Grant collected the funds to build a church, 
schoolhouse, and parsonage.&nbsp; He died at Oxenhope, many years ago, 
greatly respected by his parishioners.&nbsp; He seems to have endured 
good-naturedly much chaff from Mr. Bront&euml; and others, who always 
called him Mr. Donne.&nbsp; It was the opinion of many of his acquaintances
that the satire of <i>Shirley</i> had improved his disposition.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith left Haworth in 1844, to become curate of the parish church of
Keighley.&nbsp; He became, at a later date, incumbent of a district church,
but, his health failing, he returned to his native country, where he 
died.</p>

<p>The third curate of <i>Shirley</i>, Mr. Sweeting of Nunnely, was Mr. 
Richard Bradley, curate of Oakworth, an outlying district of Keighley 
parish.&nbsp; He is at this present time vicar of Haxby, Yorkshire, but far
too aged and infirm to have any memories of those old Haworth days.</p>
<p>Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s one other curate was Mr. De Renzi, who occupied 
the position for a little more than a year,&mdash;during <!-- page 292--><a
name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 292</span>the period, in fact, 
of Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s quarrel with Mr. Nicholls for aspiring to become
his son-in-law.&nbsp; After he left Haworth, Mr. De Renzi became a curate 
at Bradford.&nbsp; He has been dead for some years.&nbsp; The story of Mr. 
Nicholls&rsquo;s curacy belongs to another chapter.&nbsp; It is sufficient 
testimony to his worth, however, that he was able to win Charlotte 
Bront&euml; in spite of the fact that his predecessors had inspired in her 
such hearty contempt.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think he must be like all the curates 
I have seen,&rsquo; she writes of one; &lsquo;they seem to me a 
self-seeking, vain, empty race.&rsquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 293--><a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
293</span>CHAPTER XII: CHARLOTTE BRONT&Euml;&rsquo;S LOVERS</h2>
<p>Charlotte Bront&euml; was not beautiful, but she must have been 
singularly fascinating.&nbsp; That she was not beautiful there is abundant 
evidence.&nbsp; When, as a girl of fifteen, she became a pupil at Roe Head,
Mary Taylor once told her to her face that she was ugly.&nbsp; Ugly she was
not in later years.&nbsp; All her friends emphasise the soft silky hair, 
and the beautiful grey eyes which in moments of excitement seemed to 
glisten with remarkable brilliancy.&nbsp; But she had a sallow complexion, 
and a large nose slightly on one side.&nbsp; She was small in stature, and,
in fact, the casual observer would have thought her a quaint, unobtrusive 
little body.&nbsp; Mr. Grundy&rsquo;s memory was very defective when he 
wrote about the Bront&euml;s; but, with the exception of the reference to 
red hair&mdash;and all the girls had brown hair&mdash;it would seem that he
was not very wide of the mark when he wrote of &lsquo;the 
daughters&mdash;distant and distrait, large of nose, small of figure, red 
of hair, prominent of spectacles, showing great intellectual development, 
but with eyes constantly cast down, very silent, painfully 
retiring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte was indeed painfully shy.&nbsp; Miss Wheelwright, who saw much
of her during her visits to London in the years of her literary success, 
says that she would never enter a room without sheltering herself under the
wing of some taller friend.&nbsp; A resident of Haworth, still alive, 
remembers the girls passing him frequently on the way down to the <!-- page
294--><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>shops, and 
their hands would involuntarily be lifted to the face on the side nearest 
to him, with a view to avoid observation.&nbsp; This was not affectation; 
it was absolute timidity.&nbsp; Miss Wheelwright always thought George 
Richmond&rsquo;s portrait&mdash;for which Charlotte sat during a stay at 
Dr. Wheelwright&rsquo;s in Phillimore Place&mdash;entirely 
flattering.&nbsp; Many of Charlotte&rsquo;s friends were pleased that it 
should be so, but there can be no doubt that the magnificent expanse of 
forehead was an exaggeration.&nbsp; Charlotte&rsquo;s forehead was high, 
but very narrow.</p>
<p>All this is comparatively unimportant.&nbsp; Charlotte certainly was 
under no illusion; and we who revere her to-day as one of the greatest of 
Englishwomen need have no illusions.&nbsp; It is sufficient that, if not 
beautiful, Charlotte possessed a singular charm of manner, and, when 
interested, an exhilarating flow of conversation which carried intelligent 
men off their feet.&nbsp; She had at least four offers of marriage.&nbsp; 
The three lovers she refused have long since gone to their graves, and 
there can be no harm now in referring to the actual facts as they present 
themselves in Charlotte&rsquo;s letters.&nbsp; Two of these offers of 
marriage were made in one year, when she was twenty-three years of 
age.&nbsp; Her first proposal came from the brother of her friend Ellen 
Nussey.&nbsp; Henry Nussey was a curate at Donnington when he asked 
Charlotte Bront&euml; to be his wife.&nbsp; Two letters on the subject, one
of which is partly printed in a mangled form in Mrs. Gaskell&rsquo;s 
Memoir, speak for themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO REV. HENRY NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>March</i> 5<i>th</i>, 1839.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Before answering 
your letter I might have spent a long time in consideration of its subject;
but as from the first moment of its reception and perusal I determined on 
what course to pursue, it seemed to me that delay was wholly 
unnecessary.&nbsp; You are aware that I have many reasons to feel <!-- page
295--><a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>grateful to 
your family, that I have peculiar reasons for affection towards one at 
least of your sisters, and also that I highly esteem yourself&mdash;do not 
therefore accuse me of wrong motives when I say that my answer to your 
proposal must be a <i>decided negative</i>.&nbsp; In forming this decision,
I trust I have listened to the dictates of conscience more than to those of
inclination.&nbsp; I have no personal repugnance to the idea of a union 
with you, but I feel convinced that mine is not the sort of disposition 
calculated to form the happiness of a man like you.&nbsp; It has always 
been my habit to study the characters of those amongst whom I chance to be 
thrown, and I think I know yours and can imagine what description of woman 
would suit you for a wife.&nbsp; The character should not be too marked, 
ardent, and original, her temper should be mild, her piety undoubted, her 
spirits even and cheerful, and her <i>personal attractions</i> sufficient 
to please your eyes and gratify your just pride.&nbsp; As for me, you do 
not know me; I am not the serious, grave, cool-headed individual you 
suppose; you would think me romantic and eccentric; you would say I was 
satirical and severe.&nbsp; However, I scorn deceit, and I will never, for 
the sake of attaining the distinction of matrimony and escaping the stigma 
of an old maid, take a worthy man whom I am conscious I cannot render 
happy.&nbsp; Before I conclude, let me thank you warmly for your other 
proposal regarding the school near Donnington.&nbsp; It is kind in you to 
take so much interest about me; but the fact is, I could not at present 
enter upon such a project because I have not the capital necessary to 
insure success.&nbsp; It is a pleasure to me to hear that you are so 
comfortably settled and that your health is so much improved.&nbsp; I trust
God will continue His kindness towards you.&nbsp; Let me say also that I 
admire the good-sense and absence of flattery and cant which your letter 
displayed.&nbsp; Farewell.&nbsp; I shall always be glad to hear from you as
a <i>friend</i>.&mdash;Believe me, yours truly,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>March</i> 12<i>th</i>, 1839.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dearest Ellen</span>,&mdash;When your 
letter was put into my <!-- page 296--><a name="page296"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 296</span>hands, I said, &ldquo;She is coming at last, I
hope,&rdquo; but when I opened it and found what the contents were, I was 
vexed to the heart.&nbsp; You need not ask me to go to Brookroyd any 
more.&nbsp; Once for all, and at the hazard of being called the most stupid
little wretch that ever existed, I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> go till you have been
to Haworth.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t blame <i>you</i>, I believe you would come 
if you might; perhaps I ought not to blame others, but I am grieved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anne goes to Blake Hall on the 8th of April, unless some further 
unseen cause of delay should occur.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard nothing more 
from Mrs. Thos. Brook as yet.&nbsp; Papa wishes me to remain at home a 
little longer, but I begin to be anxious to set to work again; and yet it 
will be <i>hard work</i> after the indulgence of so many weeks, to return 
to that dreary &ldquo;gin-horse&rdquo; round.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ask me, my dear Ellen, whether I have received a letter from 
Henry.&nbsp; I have, about a week since.&nbsp; The contents, I confess, did
a little surprise me, but I kept them to myself, and unless you had 
questioned me on the subject, I would never have adverted to it.&nbsp; 
Henry says he is comfortably settled at Donnington, that his health is much
improved, and that it is his intention to take pupils after Easter.&nbsp; 
He then intimates that in due time he should want a wife to take care of 
his pupils, and frankly asks me to be that wife.&nbsp; Altogether the 
letter is written without cant or flattery, and in a common-sense style, 
which does credit to his judgment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, my dear Ellen, there were in this proposal some things which
might have proved a strong temptation.&nbsp; I thought if I were to marry 
Henry Nussey, his sister could live with me, and how happy I should 
be.&nbsp; But again I asked myself two questions: Do I love him as much as 
a woman ought to love the man she marries?&nbsp; Am I the person best 
qualified to make him happy?&nbsp; Alas! Ellen, my conscience answered 
<i>no</i> to both these questions.&nbsp; I felt that though I esteemed, 
though I had a kindly leaning towards him, because he is an amiable and 
well-disposed man, yet I had not, and could not have, that intense 
attachment which would make me willing to die for <!-- page 297--><a 
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>him; and, if ever I 
marry, it must be in that light of adoration that I will regard my 
husband.&nbsp; Ten to one I shall never have the chance again; but 
<i>n&rsquo;importe</i>.&nbsp; Moreover, I was aware that Henry knew so 
little of me he could hardly be conscious to whom he was writing.&nbsp; 
Why, it would startle him to see me in my natural home character; he would 
think I was a wild, romantic enthusiast indeed.&nbsp; I could not sit all 
day long making a grave face before my husband.&nbsp; I would laugh, and 
satirise, and say whatever came into my head first.&nbsp; And if he were a 
clever man, and loved me, the whole world weighed in the balance against 
his smallest wish should be light as air.&nbsp; Could I, knowing my mind to
be such as that, conscientiously say that I would take a grave, quiet, 
young man like Henry?&nbsp; No, it would have been deceiving him, and 
deception of that sort is beneath me.&nbsp; So I wrote a long letter back, 
in which I expressed my refusal as gently as I could, and also candidly 
avowed my reasons for that refusal.&nbsp; I described to him, too, the sort
of character that would suit him for a wife.&mdash;Good-bye, my dear 
Ellen.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Nussey was a very good man, with a capacity for making himself 
generally esteemed, becoming in turn vicar of Earnley, near Chichester, and
afterwards of Hathersage, in Derbyshire.&nbsp; It was honourable to his 
judgment that he had aspired to marry Charlotte Bront&euml;, who, as we 
know, had neither money nor much personal attraction, and at the time no 
possible prospect of literary fame.&nbsp; Her common-sense letter in reply 
to his proposal had the desired effect.&nbsp; He speedily took the 
proffered advice, and six months later we find her sending him a letter of 
congratulation upon his engagement to be married.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have delayed 
answering your last communication in the hopes of receiving a letter from 
Ellen, that I might be able to transmit to you the latest news from 
Brookroyd; <!-- page 298--><a name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
298</span>however, as she does not write, I think I ought to put off my 
reply no longer lest you should begin to think me negligent.&nbsp; As you 
rightly conjecture, I had heard a little hint of what you allude to before,
and the account gave me pleasure, coupled as it was with the assurance that
the object of your regard is a worthy and estimable woman.&nbsp; The step 
no doubt will by many of your friends be considered scarcely as a prudent 
one, <i>since</i> fortune is not amongst the number of the young 
lady&rsquo;s advantages.&nbsp; For my own part, I must confess that I 
esteem you the more for not hunting after wealth if there be strength of 
mind, firmness of principle, and sweetness of temper to compensate for the 
absence of that usually all-powerful attraction.&nbsp; The wife who brings 
riches to her husband sometimes also brings an idea of her own importance 
and a tenacity about what she conceives to be her rights, little calculated
to produce happiness in the married state.&nbsp; Most probably she will 
wish to control when nature and affection bind her to submit&mdash;in this 
case there cannot, I should think, be much comfort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the other hand, it must be considered that when two persons 
marry without money, there ought to be moral courage and physical exertion 
to atone for the deficiency&mdash;there should be spirit to scorn 
dependence, patience to endure privation, and energy to labour for a 
livelihood.&nbsp; If there be these qualities, I think, with the blessing 
of God, those who join heart and hand have a right to expect success and a 
moderate share of happiness, even though they may have departed a step or 
two from the stern maxims of worldly prudence.&nbsp; The bread earned by 
honourable toil is sweeter than the bread of idleness; and mutual love and 
domestic calm are treasures far preferable to the possessions rust can 
corrupt and moths consume away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I enjoyed my late excursion with Ellen with the greater zest 
because such pleasures have not often chanced to fall in my way.&nbsp; I 
will not tell you what I thought of the sea, because I should fall into my 
besetting sin of enthusiasm.&nbsp; I may, however, say that its glories, 
changes, its ebbs and flow, the sound of its restless waves, formed a 
subject for contemplation that never wearied either the eye, the ear, or 
the mind.&nbsp; Our visit <!-- page 299--><a name="page299"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 299</span>at Easton was extremely pleasant; I shall 
always feel grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Hudson for their kindness.&nbsp; We 
saw Agnes Burton, during our stay, and called on two of your former 
parishioners&mdash;Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Dalton.&nbsp; I was pleased to hear 
your name mentioned by them in terms of encomium and sincere regard.&nbsp; 
Ellen will have detailed to you all the minutia of our excursion; a 
recapitulation from me would therefore be tedious.&nbsp; I am happy to say 
that her health appeared to be greatly improved by the change of air and 
regular exercise.&nbsp; I am still at home, as I have not yet heard of any 
situation which meets with the approbation of my friends.&nbsp; I begin, 
however, to grow exceedingly impatient of a prolonged period of 
inaction.&nbsp; I feel I ought to be doing something for myself, for my 
health is now so perfectly re-established by this long rest that it affords
me no further pretext for indolence.&nbsp; With every wish for your future 
welfare, and with the hope that whenever your proposed union takes place it
may contribute in the highest sense to your good and 
happiness,&mdash;Believe me, your sincere friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. 
Bront&euml;</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Remember me to your sister Mercy, who, I 
understand, is for the present your companion and housekeeper.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The correspondence did not end here.&nbsp; Indeed, Charlotte was so 
excellent a letter-writer, that it must have been hard indeed for any one 
who had had any experience of her in that capacity to readily forgo its 
continuance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO REV. HENRY NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>May</i> 26<i>th</i>, 1840.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;In looking over my 
papers this morning I found a letter from you of the date of last February 
with the mark upon it unanswered.&nbsp; Your sister Ellen often accuses me 
of want of punctuality in answering letters, and I think her accusation is 
here justified.&nbsp; However, I give you credit for as much 
considerateness as will induce you to excuse a greater fault than this, 
especially as I shall hasten directly to repair it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fact is, when the letter came Ellen was staying with <!-- 
page 300--><a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>me, and
I was so fully occupied in talking to her that I had no time to think of 
writing to others.&nbsp; This is no great compliment, but it is no insult 
either.&nbsp; You know Ellen&rsquo;s worth, you know how seldom I see her, 
you partly know my regard for her; and from these premises you may easily 
draw the inference that her company, when once obtained, is too valuable to
be wasted for a moment.&nbsp; One woman can appreciate the value of another
better than a man can do.&nbsp; Men very often only see the outside gloss 
which dazzles in prosperity, women have opportunities for closer 
observation, and they learn to value those qualities which are useful in 
adversity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is much, too, in that mild even temper and that placid 
equanimity which keep the domestic hearth always bright and 
peaceful&mdash;this is better than the ardent nature that changes twenty 
times in a day.&nbsp; I have studied Ellen and I think she would make a 
good wife&mdash;that is, if she had a good husband.&nbsp; If she married a 
fool or a tyrant there is spirit enough in her composition to withstand the
dictates of either insolence or weakness, though even then I doubt not her 
sense would teach her to make the best of a bad bargain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will see my letters are all didactic.&nbsp; They contain no 
news, because I know of none which I think it would interest you to hear 
repeated.&nbsp; I am still at home, in very good health and spirits, and 
uneasy only because I cannot yet hear of a situation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall always be glad to have a letter from you, and I promise 
when you write again to be less dilatory in answering.&nbsp; I trust your 
prospects of happiness still continue fair; and from what you say of your 
future partner I doubt not she will be one who will help you to get 
cheerfully through the difficulties of this world and to obtain a permanent
rest in the next; at least I hope such may be the case.&nbsp; You do right 
to conduct the matter with due deliberation, for on the step you are about 
to take depends the happiness of your whole lifetime.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must not again ask me to write in a regular literary way to 
you on some particular topic.&nbsp; I cannot do it at all.&nbsp; Do you 
think I am a blue-stocking?&nbsp; I feel half inclined to laugh at you for 
the idea, but perhaps you would be angry.&nbsp; What was <!-- page 301--><a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>the topic to 
be?&nbsp; Chemistry? or astronomy? or mechanics? or conchology? or 
entomology? or what other ology?&nbsp; I know nothing at all about any of 
these.&nbsp; I am not scientific; I am not a linguist.&nbsp; You think me 
far more learned than I am.&nbsp; If I told you all my ignorance, I am 
afraid you would be shocked; however, as I wish still to retain a little 
corner in your good opinion, I will hold my tongue.&mdash;Believe me, yours
respectfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. 
Bront&euml;</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO REV. HENRY NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>January</i> 11th, 1841.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;It is time I should 
reply to your last, as I shall fail in fulfilling my promise of not being 
so dilatory as on a former occasion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall be glad to receive the poetry which you offer to send 
me.&nbsp; You ask me to return the gift in kind.&nbsp; How do you know that
I have it in my power to comply with that request?&nbsp; Once indeed I was 
very poetical, when I was sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, and nineteen years 
old, but I am now twenty-four, approaching twenty-five, and the 
intermediate years are those which begin to rob life of some of its 
superfluous colouring.&nbsp; At this age it is time that the imagination 
should be pruned and trimmed, that the judgment should be cultivated, and a
few, at least, of the countless illusions of early youth should be cleared 
away.&nbsp; I have not written poetry for a long while.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will excuse the dulness, morality, and monotony of this 
epistle, and&mdash;Believe me, with all good wishes for your welfare here 
and hereafter, your sincere friend,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C.

<p>This letter closes the correspondence; but, as we have seen, Charlotte 
spent three pleasant weeks in Mr. Nussey&rsquo;s home with his sister Ellen
when that gentleman became vicar of Hathersage, in Derbyshire.&nbsp; She 
thus congratulates her friend when Mr. Nussey is appointed to the latter 
living.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Nell</span>,&mdash;I am very glad to 
hear of Henry&rsquo;s good fortune.&nbsp; <!-- page 302--><a 
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>It proves to me what 
an excellent thing perseverance is for getting on in the world.&nbsp; Calm 
self-confidence (not impudence, for that is vulgar and repulsive) is an 
admirable quality; but how are those not naturally gifted with it to attain
it?&nbsp; We all here get on much as usual.&nbsp; Papa wishes he could hear
of a curate, that Mr. Smith may be at liberty to go.&nbsp; Good-bye, dear 
Ellen.&nbsp; I wish to you and yours happiness, health, and prosperity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Write again before you go to Burlington.&nbsp; My best love to 
Mary.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, as I have said, a second lover appeared on the field in this 
same year, 1839, and the quickness of his wooing is a remarkable testimony 
to the peculiar fascination which Miss Bront&euml; must have exercised.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>August</i> 4<i>th</i>, 1839.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dearest Ellen</span>,&mdash;I have an odd 
circumstance to relate to you&mdash;prepare for a hearty laugh!&nbsp; The 
other day Mr. Hodgson, papa&rsquo;s former curate, now a vicar, came over 
to spend the day with us, bringing with him his own curate.&nbsp; The 
latter gentleman, by name Mr. Price, is a young Irish clergyman, fresh from
Dublin University.&nbsp; It was the first time we had any of us seen him, 
but, however, after the manner of his countrymen, he soon made himself at 
home.&nbsp; His character quickly appeared in his conversation: witty, 
lively, ardent, clever too, but deficient in the dignity and discretion of 
an Englishman.&nbsp; At home, you know, Ellen, I talk with ease, and am 
never shy, never weighed down and oppressed by that miserable <i>mauvaise 
honte</i> which torments and constrains me elsewhere.&nbsp; So I conversed 
with this Irishman and laughed at his jests, and though I saw faults in his
character, excused them because of the amusement his originality 
afforded.&nbsp; I cooled a little, indeed, and drew in towards the latter 
part of the evening, because he began to season his conversation with 
something of Hibernian flattery, which I did not quite relish.&nbsp; 
However, they went away, and no more was thought about them.&nbsp; A few 
days after I got a letter, the <!-- page 303--><a name="page303"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 303</span>direction of which puzzled me, it being in a 
hand I was not accustomed to see.&nbsp; Evidently, it was neither from you 
nor Mary Taylor, my only correspondents.&nbsp; Having opened and read it, 
it proved to be a declaration of attachment and proposal of matrimony, 
expressed in the ardent language of the sapient young Irishman!&nbsp; Well!
thought I, I have heard of love at first sight, but this beats all.&nbsp; I
leave you to guess what my answer would be, convinced that you will not do 
me the injustice of guessing wrong.&nbsp; When we meet I&rsquo;ll show you 
the letter.&nbsp; I hope you are laughing heartily.&nbsp; This is not like 
one of my adventures, is it?&nbsp; It more nearly resembles Martha 
Taylor&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I am certainly doomed to be an old maid.&nbsp; Never 
mind, I made up my mind to that fate ever since I was twelve years 
old.&nbsp; Write soon.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. 
Bront&euml;</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was not many months after this that we hear the last of poor Mr. 
Price.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>January</i> 24<i>th</i>, 1840.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;Mr. Price is 
dead.&nbsp; He had fallen into a state of delicate health for some time, 
and the rupture of a blood-vessel carried him off.&nbsp; He was a strong, 
athletic-looking man when I saw him, and that is scarcely six months 
ago.&nbsp; Though I knew so little of him, and of course could not be 
deeply or permanently interested in what concerned him, I confess, when I 
suddenly heard he was dead, I felt both shocked and saddened: it was no 
shame to feel so, was it?&nbsp; I scold you, Ellen, for writing illegibly 
and badly, but I think you may repay the compliment with cent per cent 
interest.&nbsp; I am not in the humour for writing a long letter, so 
good-bye.&nbsp; God bless you.</p>

<p>There are many thoughts on marriage scattered through Charlotte&rsquo;s 
correspondence.&nbsp; It was a subject upon which she never wearied of 
asking questions, and of finding her own answers.&nbsp; &lsquo;I believe it
is better to marry <i>to</i> love than to <!-- page 304--><a 
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>marry <i>for</i> 
love,&rsquo; she says on one occasion.&nbsp; And in reference to the 
somewhat uncertain attitude of the admirer of one of her friends, she thus 
expresses herself to Miss Nussey:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>November</i> 20<i>th</i>, 1840.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dearest Nell</span>,&mdash;That last 
letter of thine treated of matters so high and important I cannot delay 
answering it for a day.&nbsp; Now I am about to write thee a discourse, and
a piece of advice which thou must take as if it came from thy 
grandmother.&nbsp; But in the first place, before I begin with thee, I have
a word to whisper in the ear of Mr. Vincent, and I wish it could reach 
him.&nbsp; In the name of St. Chrysostom, St. Simon, and St. Jude, why does
not that amiable young gentleman come forward like a man and say all that 
he has to say personally, instead of trifling with kinsmen and 
kinswomen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Vincent,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;go personally, 
and say: &lsquo;Miss ---, I want to speak to you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Miss --- 
will of course civilly answer: &lsquo;I am at your service, Mr. 
Vincent.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then, when the room is cleared of all but 
yourself and herself, just take a chair nearer.&nbsp; Insist upon her 
laying down that silly . . . work, and listening to you.&nbsp; Then begin, 
in a clear, distinct, deferential, but determined voice: &lsquo;Miss ---, I
have a question to put to you&mdash;a very important question: &ldquo;Will 
you take me as your husband, for better, for worse.&nbsp; I am not a rich 
man, but I have sufficient to support us.&nbsp; I am not a great man, but I
love you honestly and truly.&nbsp; Miss ---, if you knew the world better 
you would see that this is an offer not to be despised&mdash;a kind 
attached heart and a moderate competency.&rdquo;&nbsp; Do this, Mr. 
Vincent, and you may succeed.&nbsp; Go on writing sentimental and love-sick
letters to ---, and I would not give sixpence for your suit.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
So much for Mr. Vincent.&nbsp; Now Miss ---&rsquo;s turn comes to swallow 
the black bolus, called a friend&rsquo;s advice.&nbsp; Say to her: 
&ldquo;Is the man a fool? is he a knave? a humbug, a hypocrite, a ninny, a 
noodle?&nbsp; If he is any or all of these, of course there is no sense in 
trifling with him.&nbsp; Cut him short at once&mdash;blast his hopes with 
lightning rapidity and keenness.&nbsp; Is he <!-- page 305--><a 
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>something better than
this? has he at least common sense, a good disposition, a manageable 
temper?&nbsp; Then consider the matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Say further: 
&ldquo;You feel a disgust towards him now&mdash;an utter repugnance.&nbsp; 
Very likely, but be so good as to remember you don&rsquo;t know him; you 
have only had three or four days&rsquo; acquaintance with him.&nbsp; Longer
and closer intimacy might reconcile you to a wonderful extent.&nbsp; And 
now I&rsquo;ll tell you a word of truth, at which you may be offended or 
not as you like.&rdquo;&nbsp; Say to her: &ldquo;From what I know of your 
character, and I think I know it pretty well, I should say you will never 
love before marriage.&nbsp; After that ceremony is over, and after you have
had some months to settle down, and to get accustomed to the creature you 
have taken for your worse half, you will probably make a most affectionate 
and happy wife; even if the individual should not prove all you could wish,
you will be indulgent towards his little follies and foibles, and will not 
feel much annoyance at them.&nbsp; This will especially be the case if he 
should have sense sufficient to allow you to guide him in important 
matters.&rdquo;&nbsp; Say also: &ldquo;I hope you will not have the 
romantic folly to wait for what the French call &lsquo;une grande 
passion.&rsquo;&nbsp; My good girl, &lsquo;une grande passion&rsquo; is 
&lsquo;une grande folie.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mediocrity in all things is wisdom; 
mediocrity in the sensations is superlative wisdom.&rdquo;&nbsp; Say to 
her: &ldquo;When you are as old as I am (I am sixty at least, being your 
grandmother), you will find that the majority of those worldly precepts, 
whose seeming coldness shocks and repels us in youth, are founded in 
wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No girl should fall in love till the offer is actually 
made.&nbsp; This maxim is just.&nbsp; I will even extend and confirm it: No
young lady should fall in love till the offer has been made, accepted, the 
marriage ceremony performed, and the first half-year of wedded life has 
passed away.&nbsp; A woman may then begin to love, but with great 
precaution, very coolly, very moderately, very rationally.&nbsp; If she 
ever loves so much that a harsh word or a cold look cuts her to the heart 
she is a fool.&nbsp; If she ever loves so much that her husband&rsquo;s 
will is her law, and that she has got into a habit of watching his looks in
<!-- page 306--><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
306</span>order that she may anticipate his wishes, she will soon be a 
neglected fool.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have two studies: you are my study for the success, the credit,
and the respectability of a quiet, tranquil character; Mary is my study for
the contempt, the remorse, the misconstruction which follow the development
of feelings in themselves noble, warm, generous, devoted, and profound, but
which, being too freely revealed, too frankly bestowed, are not estimated 
at their real value.&nbsp; I never hope to see in this world a character 
more truly noble.&nbsp; She would die willingly for one she loved.&nbsp; 
Her intellect and her attainments are of the very highest standard.&nbsp; 
Yet I doubt whether Mary will ever marry.&nbsp; Mr. Weightman expresses 
himself very strongly on young ladies saying &ldquo;No,&rdquo; when they 
mean &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&nbsp; He assures me he means nothing 
personal.&nbsp; I hope not.&nbsp; Assuredly I quite agree with him in his 
disapprobation of such a senseless course.&nbsp; It is folly indeed for the
tongue to stammer a negative when the heart is proclaiming an 
affirmative.&nbsp; Or rather, it is an act of heroic self-denial, of which 
<i>I</i> for one confess myself wholly incapable.&nbsp; <i>I would not tell
such a lie</i> to gain a thousand pounds.&nbsp; Write to me again 
soon.&nbsp; What made you say I admired Hippocrates?&nbsp; It is a 
confounded &ldquo;fib.&rdquo;&nbsp; I tried to find something admirable in 
him, and failed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is perhaps only like the majority of men&rsquo; (she says of 
an acquaintance).&nbsp; &lsquo;Certainly those men who lead a gay life in 
their youth, and arrive at middle-age with feelings blunted and passions 
exhausted, can have but one aim in marriage&mdash;the selfish advancement 
of their interest.&nbsp; Hard to think that such men take as wives&mdash;as
second-selves&mdash;women young, modest, sincere, pure in heart and life, 
with feelings all fresh and emotions all unworn, and bind such virtue and 
vitality to their own withered existence, such sincerity to their own 
hollowness, such disinterestedness to their own haggard avarice&mdash;to 
think this, troubles the soul to its inmost depths.&nbsp; Nature and 
justice forbid the banns of such wedlock.&rsquo;</p>

operation.&nbsp; Papa must therefore necessarily take a journey to 
Manchester to consult him.&nbsp; If he judges the cataract ripe, we shall 
remain; if, on the contrary, he thinks it not yet sufficiently hardened, we
shall have to return&mdash;and Papa must remain in darkness a while 
longer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a defect in your reasoning about the feelings a wife 
ought to experience.&nbsp; Who holds the purse will wish to be master, 
Ellen, depend on it, whether man or woman.&nbsp; Who provided the cash will
now and then value himself, or herself, upon it, and, even in the case of 
ordinary minds, reproach the less wealthy partner.&nbsp; Besides, no 
husband ought to be an object of charity to his wife, as no wife to her 
husband.&nbsp; No, dear Ellen; it is doubtless pleasant to marry 
<i>well</i>, as they say, but with all pleasures are mixed bitters.&nbsp; I
do not wish for my friend a very rich husband.&nbsp; I should not like her 
to be regarded by any man ever as &ldquo;a sweet object of 
charity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Give my sincere love to all.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<p>Many years were to elapse before Charlotte Bront&euml; received her 
third offer of marriage.&nbsp; These were the years of Brussels life, and 
the year during which she lost her sisters.&nbsp; It came in the period of 
her early literary fame, and indeed was the outcome of it.&nbsp; Mr. James 
Taylor was in the employment of Smith &amp; Elder.&nbsp; He was associated 
with the literary department, and next in command to Mr. W. S. <!-- page 
308--><a name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>Williams as 
adviser to the firm.&nbsp; Mr. Williams appears to have written to Miss 
Bront&euml; suggesting that Mr. Taylor should come to Haworth in person for
the manuscript of her new novel, <i>Shirley</i>, and here is 
Charlotte&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>August</i> 24<i>th</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I think the best 
title for the book would be <i>Shirley</i>, without any explanation or 
addition&mdash;the simpler and briefer, the better.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If Mr. Taylor calls here on his return to town he might take 
charge of the Ms.; I would rather intrust it to him than send it by the 
ordinary conveyance.&nbsp; Did I see Mr. Taylor when I was in London?&nbsp;
I cannot remember him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would with pleasure offer him the homely hospitalities of the 
Parsonage for a few days, if I could at the same time offer him the company
of a brother, or if my father were young enough and strong enough to walk 
with him on the moors and show him the neighbourhood, or if the peculiar 
retirement of papa&rsquo;s habits were not such as to render it irksome to 
him to give much of his society to a stranger, even in the house.&nbsp; 
Without being in the least misanthropical or sour-natured, papa habitually 
prefers solitude to society, and custom is a tyrant whose fetters it would 
now be impossible for him to break.&nbsp; Were it not for difficulties of 
this sort, I believe I should ere this have asked you to come down to 
Yorkshire.&nbsp; Papa, I know, would receive any friend of Mr. 
Smith&rsquo;s with perfect kindness and goodwill, but I likewise know that,
unless greatly put out of his way, he could not give a guest much of his 
company, and that, consequently, his entertainment would be but dull.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will see the force of these considerations, and understand 
why I only ask Mr. Taylor to come for a day instead of requesting the 
pleasure of his company for a longer period; you will believe me also, and 
so will he, when I say I shall be most happy to see him.&nbsp; He will find
Haworth a strange uncivilised little place, such as, I daresay, he never 
saw before.&nbsp; <!-- page 309--><a name="page309"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 309</span>It is twenty miles distant from Leeds; he will
have to come by rail to Keighley (there are trains every two hours I 
believe).&nbsp; He must remember that at a station called Shipley the 
carriages are changed, otherwise they will take him on to Skipton or Colne,
or I know not where.&nbsp; When he reaches Keighley, he will yet have four 
miles to travel; a conveyance may be hired at the Devonshire 
Arms&mdash;there is no coach or other regular communication.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to hear from him before he comes, and to know on 
what day to expect him, that I may have the MS. ready; if it is not quite 
finished I might send the concluding chapter or two by post.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I advise you to send this letter to Mr. Taylor&mdash;it will save

<p>Mr. Taylor was small and red-haired.&nbsp; There are two portraits of 
him before me.&nbsp; They indicate a determined, capable man, thick-set, 
well bearded: on the whole a vigorous and interesting personality.&nbsp; In
any case, Mr. Taylor lost his heart to Charlotte, and was much more 
persistent than earlier lovers.&nbsp; He had also the advantage of Mr. 
Bront&euml;&rsquo;s goodwill.&nbsp; This is all there is to add to the 
letters themselves.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I found after 
sealing my last note to you that I had forgotten after all to inclose 
Amelia&rsquo;s letter; however, it appears it does not signify.&nbsp; While
I think of it I must refer to an act of petty larceny committed by me when 
I was last at Brookroyd.&nbsp; Do you remember lending me a parasol, which 
I should have left with you when we parted at Leeds?&nbsp; I unconsciously 
carried it away in my hand.&nbsp; You shall have it when you next come to 
Haworth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish, dear Ellen, you would tell me what is the &ldquo;twaddle 
about my marrying, etc.,&rdquo; which you hear.&nbsp; If I knew the details
I should have a better chance of guessing the quarter from which such 
gossip comes&mdash;as it is, I am quite at a loss.&nbsp; Whom am I to 
marry?&nbsp; I think I have scarcely seen a single man with whom such a 
union would be possible since I left London.&nbsp; Doubtless there are men 
whom, if I chose to encourage, I might marry; but no matrimonial lot is 
even remotely offered me which seems to me truly desirable.&nbsp; And even 
if that were the case, there would be many obstacles.&nbsp; The least 
allusion to such a thing is most offensive to papa.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An article entitled <i>Currer Bell</i> has lately appeared in the
<i>Palladium</i>, a new periodical published in Edinburgh.&nbsp; It is an 
eloquent production, and one of such warm sympathy and high appreciation as
I had never expected to see.&nbsp; It makes mistakes about authorships, 
etc., but these I hope one day to set right.&nbsp; Mr. Taylor (the little 
man) first informed me of this article.&nbsp; I was somewhat surprised to 
receive his letter, having concluded nine months ago that there would be no
more correspondence from that quarter.&nbsp; I inclose you a note from him 
received subsequently, in answer to my acknowledgment.&nbsp; Read it and 
tell me exactly how it impresses you regarding the writer&rsquo;s 
character, etc.&nbsp; His little newspaper disappeared for some weeks, and 
I thought it was gone to the tomb of the Capulets; however, it has 
reappeared, with an explanation that he had feared its regular transmission
might rather annoy than gratify.&nbsp; <!-- page 311--><a 
name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>I told him this was a
mistake&mdash;that I was well enough pleased to receive it, but hoped he 
would not make a task of sending it.&nbsp; For the rest, I cannot consider 
myself placed under any personal obligation by accepting this newspaper, 
for it belongs to the establishment of Smith &amp; Elder.&nbsp; This little
Taylor is deficient neither in spirit nor sense.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The report about my having published again is, of course, an 
arrant lie.</p>

<p>Her friend&rsquo;s reference to <i>Jupiter</i> is to another suggested 
lover, and the kindly allusion to the &lsquo;little man&rsquo; may be taken
to imply that had he persevered, or not gone off to India, whither he was 
sent to open a branch establishment in Bombay for Smith &amp; Elder, Mr. 
Taylor might possibly have been successful in the long run.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Nell</span>,&mdash;I am very sorry to 
hear that Amelia is again far from well; but I think both she and I should 
try and not be too anxious.&nbsp; Even if matters do not prosper this time,
all may go as well some future day.&nbsp; I think it is not these 
<i>early</i> mishaps that break the constitution, but those which occur in 
a much later stage.&nbsp; She must take heart&mdash;there may yet be a 
round dozen of little Joe Taylors to look after&mdash;run after&mdash;to 
sort and switch and train up in the way they should go&mdash;that is, with 
a generous use of pickled birch.&nbsp; From whom do you think I have 
received a couple of notes lately?&nbsp; From Alice.&nbsp; They are 
returned from the Continent, it seems, and are now at Torquay.&nbsp; The 
first note touched me a little by what I thought its subdued tone; I 
trusted her character might be greatly improved.&nbsp; There were, indeed, 
traces of the &ldquo;old Adam,&rdquo; but such as I was willing to 
overlook.&nbsp; I answered her soon and kindly.&nbsp; In reply I received 
to-day a longish letter, full of clap-trap sentiment and humbugging 
attempts at fine writing.&nbsp; In <!-- page 312--><a 
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>each production the 
old trading spirit peeps out; she asks for autographs.&nbsp; It seems she 
had read in some paper that I was staying with Miss Martineau; thereupon 
she applies for specimens of her handwriting, and Wordsworth&rsquo;s, and 
Southey&rsquo;s, and my own.&nbsp; The account of her health, if given by 
any one else, would grieve and alarm me.&nbsp; She talks of fearing that 
her constitution is almost broken by repeated trials, and intimates a doubt
as to whether she shall live long: but, remembering her of old, I have good
hopes that this may be a mistake.&nbsp; Her &ldquo;beloved papa and 
mama&rdquo; and her &ldquo;precious sister,&rdquo; she says, are living, 
and &ldquo;gradely.&rdquo;&nbsp; (That last is my word.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know whether they use it in Birstall as they do here&mdash;it means in a 
middling way.)</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are to say no more about &ldquo;Jupiter&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;Venus&rdquo;&mdash;what do you mean by such heathen trash?&nbsp; The
fact is, no fallacy can be wilder, and I won&rsquo;t have it hinted at even
in jest, because my common sense laughs it to scorn.&nbsp; The idea of the 
&ldquo;little man&rdquo; shocks me less&mdash;it would be a more likely 
match if &ldquo;matches&rdquo; were at all in question, which <i>they are 
not</i>.&nbsp; He still sends his little newspaper; and the other day there
came a letter of a bulk, volume, pith, judgment, and knowledge, worthy to 
have been the product of a giant.&nbsp; You may laugh as much and as 
wickedly as you please; but the fact is, there is a quiet constancy about 
this, my diminutive and red-haired friend, which adds a foot to his 
stature, turns his sandy locks dark, and altogether dignifies him a good 
deal in my estimation.&nbsp; However, I am not bothered by much vehement 
ardour&mdash;there is the nicest distance and respect preserved now, which 
makes matters very comfortable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is all nonsense, Nell, and so you will understand 
it.&mdash;Yours very faithfully,</p>

particularly directed my attention was read with pleasure and interest, and
if I do not now discuss it more at length, it is because I am well aware 
how completely your attention must be at present engrossed, since, if I

are now on the eve of quitting England for India.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will limit myself, then, to the expression of a sincere wish

the great change of climate will bring with it no corresponding risk to 
health.&nbsp; I should think you will be missed in Cornhill, but doubtless 
&ldquo;business&rdquo; is a Moloch which demands such sacrifices.</p>

you in time.&nbsp; I will now only say that both my father and myself will 
have pleasure in seeing you on your return from Scotland&mdash;a pleasure

<p>&lsquo;I do most entirely agree with you in what you say about Miss

cannot be otherwise.&nbsp; The change of climate is all I fear; but

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>April</i> 5<i>th</i>, 1851.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;Mr. Taylor has been 
and is gone; things are just as they were.&nbsp; I only know in addition to
the slight information I possessed before, that this Indian undertaking is 
necessary to the continued prosperity of the firm of Smith, Elder, &amp; 
Co., and that he, Taylor, alone was pronounced to possess the power and 
means to carry it out successfully&mdash;that mercantile honour, combined 
with his own sense of duty, obliged him to accept the post of honour and of
danger to which he has been appointed, that he goes with great personal 
reluctance, and that he contemplates an absence of five years.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He looked much thinner and older.&nbsp; I saw him very near, and 
once through my glass; the resemblance to Branwell struck me 
forcibly&mdash;it is marked.&nbsp; He is not ugly, but very peculiar; the 
lines in his face show an inflexibility, and, I must add, a hardness of 
character which do not attract.&nbsp; As he stood near me, as he looked at 
me in his keen way, it was all I could do to stand my ground tranquilly and
steadily, and not to recoil as before.&nbsp; It is no use saying anything 
if I am not candid.&nbsp; I avow then, that on this occasion, predisposed 
as I was to regard him very favourably, his manners and his personal 
presence scarcely pleased me more than at the first interview.&nbsp; He 
gave me a book at parting, requesting in his brief way that I would keep it
for his sake, and adding hastily, &ldquo;I shall hope to hear from you in 
India&mdash;your letters <i>have</i> been and <i>will</i> be a greater 
refreshment than you can think or I can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And so he is gone; and stern and abrupt little man as he <!-- 
page 315--><a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
315</span>is&mdash;too often jarring as are his manners&mdash;his absence 
and the exclusion of his idea from my mind leave me certainly with less 
support and in deeper solitude than before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You see, dear Nell, though we are still precisely on the same 
level&mdash;<i>you</i> are not isolated.&nbsp; I feel that there is a 
certain mystery about this transaction yet, and whether it will ever be 
cleared up to me I do not know; however, my plain duty is to wean my mind 
from the subject, and if possible to avoid pondering over it.&nbsp; In his 
conversation he seemed studiously to avoid reference to Mr. Smith 
individually, speaking always of the &ldquo;house&rdquo;&mdash;the 
&ldquo;firm.&rdquo;&nbsp; He seemed throughout quite as excited and nervous
as when I first saw him.&nbsp; I feel that in his way he has a regard for 
me&mdash;a regard which I cannot bring myself entirely to reciprocate in 
kind, and yet its withdrawal leaves a painful blank.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>April</i> 9<i>th</i>, 1851.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Nell</span>,&mdash;Thank you for your 
kind note; it was just like you to write it <i>though</i> it was your 
school-day.&nbsp; I never knew you to let a slight impediment stand in the 
way of a friendly action.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly I shall not soon forget last Friday, and <i>never</i>, 
I think, the evening and night succeeding that morning and afternoon.&nbsp;
Evils seldom come singly.&nbsp; And soon after Mr. Taylor was gone, papa, 
who had been better, grew much worse.&nbsp; He went to bed early, and was 
very sick and ill for an hour; and when at last he began to doze, and I 
left him, I came down to the dining-room with a sense of weight, fear, and 
desolation hard to express and harder to endure.&nbsp; A wish that you were
with me <i>did</i> cross my mind, but I repulsed it as a most selfish wish;
indeed, it was only short-lived: my natural tendency in moments of this 
sort is to get through the struggle alone&mdash;to think that one is 
burdening and racking others makes all worse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You speak to me in soft consolating accents, but I hold far 
sterner language to myself, dear Nell.</p>
<p><!-- page 316--><a name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
316</span>&lsquo;An absence of five years&mdash;a dividing expanse of three
oceans&mdash;the wide difference between a man&rsquo;s active career and a 
woman&rsquo;s passive existence&mdash;these things are almost equivalent to
an eternal separation.&nbsp; But there is another thing which forms a 
barrier more difficult to pass than any of these.&nbsp; Would Mr. Taylor 
and I ever suit?&nbsp; Could I ever feel for him enough love to accept him 
as a husband?&nbsp; Friendship&mdash;gratitude&mdash;esteem I have, but 
each moment he came near me, and that I could see his eyes fastened on me, 
my veins ran ice.&nbsp; Now that he is away I feel far more gently towards 
him; it is only close by that I grow rigid&mdash;stiffening with a strange 
mixture of apprehension and anger, which nothing softens but his retreat 
and a perfect subduing of his manner.&nbsp; I did not want to be proud, nor
intend to be proud, but I was forced to be so.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most true is it that we are over-ruled by one above us&mdash;that
in his hands our very will is as clay in the hands of the potter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa continues very far from well, though yesterday, and I hope 
this morning, he is a little better.&nbsp; How is your mother?&nbsp; Give 
my love to her and your sister.&nbsp; How are you?&nbsp; Have you suffered 
from tic since you returned home?&nbsp; Did they think you improved in 
looks?</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I have heard from
Mr. Taylor to-day&mdash;a quiet little note.&nbsp; He returned to London a 
week since on Saturday; he has since kindly chosen and sent me a parcel of 
books.&nbsp; He leaves England May 20th.&nbsp; His note concludes with 
asking whether he has any chance of seeing me in London before that 
time.&nbsp; I must tell him that I have already fixed June for my visit, 
and therefore, in all human probability, we shall see each other no 
more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is still a want of plain mutual understanding in this 
business, and there is sadness and pain in more ways than one.&nbsp; My 
conscience, I can truly say, does not <i>now</i> accuse me of <!-- page 
317--><a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>having 
treated Mr. Taylor with injustice or unkindness.&nbsp; What I once did 
wrong in this way, I have endeavoured to remedy both to himself and in 
speaking of him to others&mdash;Mr. Smith to wit, though I more than doubt 
whether that last opinion will ever reach him.&nbsp; I am sure he has 
estimable and sterling qualities; but with every disposition and with every
wish, with every intention even to look on him in the most favourable point
of view at his last visit, it was impossible to me in my inward heart to 
think of him as one that might one day be acceptable as a husband.&nbsp; It
would sound harsh were I to tell even <i>you</i> of the estimate I felt 
compelled to form respecting him.&nbsp; Dear Nell, I looked for something 
of the gentleman&mdash;something I mean of the <i>natural</i> gentleman; 
you know I can dispense with acquired polish, and for looks, I know myself 
too well to think that I have any right to be exacting on that point.&nbsp;
I could not find one gleam, I could not see one passing glimpse of true 
good-breeding.&nbsp; It is hard to say, but it is true.&nbsp; In mind too, 
though clever, he is second-rate&mdash;thoroughly second-rate.&nbsp; One 
does not like to say these things, but one had better be honest.&nbsp; Were
I to marry him my heart would bleed in pain and humiliation; I could not, 
<i>could not</i> look up to him.&nbsp; No; if Mr. Taylor be the only 
husband fate offers to me, single I must always remain.&nbsp; But yet, at 
times I grieve for him, and perhaps it is superfluous, for I cannot think 
he will suffer much: a hard nature, occupation, and change of scene will 
befriend him.</p>

kindness of his manner when he bid him good-bye, exhorting him to be

all good wishes, struck me with some astonishment.&nbsp; Whenever he has 
alluded to him since, it has been with significant eulogy.&nbsp; When I

objection.&nbsp; You say papa has penetration.&nbsp; On this subject I

<i>November</i> 15<i>th</i>, 1851.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Both your 
communications reached me safely&mdash;the note of the 17th September and 
the letter of the 2nd October.&nbsp; You do yourself less than justice when
you stigmatise the latter as &ldquo;ill-written.&rdquo;&nbsp; I found it 
quite legible, nor did I lose a word, though the lines and letters were so 
close.&nbsp; I should have been sorry if such had not been the case, as it 
appeared to me throughout highly interesting.&nbsp; It is observable that 
the very same information which we have previously collected, perhaps with 
rather languid attention, from printed books, when placed before us in 
familiar manuscript, and comprising <!-- page 320--><a 
name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 320</span>the actual experience
of a person with whom we are acquainted, acquires a new and vital interest:
when we know the narrator we seem to realise the tale.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The bath scene amused me much.&nbsp; Your account of that 
operation tallies in every point with Mr. Thackeray&rsquo;s description in 
the <i>Journey from Cornhill to Grand Cairo</i>.&nbsp; The usage seems a 
little rough, and I cannot help thinking that equal benefit might be 
obtained through less violent means; but I suppose without the previous 
fatigue the after-sensation would not be so enjoyable, and no doubt it is 
that indolent after-sensation which the self-indulgent Mahometans chiefly 
cultivate.&nbsp; I think you did right to disdain it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would seem to me a matter of great regret that the society at 
Bombay should be so deficient in all intellectual attraction.&nbsp; 
Perhaps, however, your occupations will so far absorb your thoughts as to 
prevent them from dwelling painfully on this circumstance.&nbsp; No doubt 
there will be moments when you will look back to London and Scotland, and 
the friends you have left there, with some yearning; but I suppose business
has its own excitement.&nbsp; The new country, the new scenes too, must

you will probably soon become reconciled to a change which, for some minds,
would too closely resemble exile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear the climate&mdash;such as you describe it&mdash;must be 
very trying to an European constitution.&nbsp; In your first letter, you 
mentioned October as the month of danger; it is now over.&nbsp; Whether you
have passed its ordeal safely, must yet for some weeks remain unknown to 
your friends in England&mdash;they can but <i>wish</i> that such may be the
case.&nbsp; You will not expect me to write a letter that shall form a 
parallel with your own either in quantity or quality; what I write must be 
brief, and what I communicate must be commonplace and of trivial 
interest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My father, I am thankful to say, continues in pretty good 
health.&nbsp; I read portions of your letter to him and he was interested 
in hearing them.&nbsp; He charged me when I wrote to convey his very kind 
remembrances.</p>

taking leave at Haworth you said something about writing from India, but I 
doubted at the time whether it was not one of those forms of speech which 
politeness dictates; and as time passed, and I did not hear from you, I 
became confirmed in this view of the subject.&nbsp; With every good wish

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>November</i> 19<i>th</i>, 1851.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;All here is much as 
usual, and I was thinking of writing to you this morning when I received 
your note.&nbsp; I am glad to hear your mother bears this severe weather 
tolerably, as papa does also.&nbsp; I had a cold, chiefly in the throat and
chest, but I applied cold water, which relieved me, I think, far better 
than hot applications would have done.&nbsp; The only events in my life 
consist in that little change occasional letters bring.&nbsp; I have had 
two from Miss Wooler since she left Haworth which touched me much.&nbsp; 
She seems to think so much of a little congenial company.&nbsp; She says 
she has not for many days known such enjoyment as she experienced during 
the ten days she stayed here.&nbsp; Yet you know what Haworth is&mdash;dull
enough.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How could you imagine your last letter offended me?&nbsp; I only 
disagreed with you on <i>one point</i>.&nbsp; The little man&rsquo;s 
disdain of the sensual pleasure of a Turkish bath had, I must own, my 
approval.&nbsp; Before answering his epistle I got up my courage to write 
to Mr. Williams, through whose hands or those of Mr. Smith I knew the 
Indian letter had come, and beg him to give me an impartial judgment of Mr.
Taylor&rsquo;s character and disposition, owning that I was very much in 
the dark.&nbsp; I did not like to continue correspondence without further 
information.&nbsp; I got the answer, which I inclose.&nbsp; You say nothing
about the Hunsworth Turtle-doves&mdash;how are they? and how is the branch 
of promise?&nbsp; I hope doing well.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am glad of the 
opportunity of writing to you, for I have long wished to send you a little 
note, and was only deterred from doing so by the conviction that the period
preceding Christmas must be a very busy one to you.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have wished to thank you for your last, which gave me very 
genuine pleasure.&nbsp; You ascribe to Mr. Taylor an excellent character; 
such a man&rsquo;s friendship, at any rate, should not be disregarded; and 
if the principles and disposition be what you say, faults of manner and 
even of temper ought to weigh light in the balance.&nbsp; I always believed
in his judgment and good-sense, but what I doubted was his 
kindness&mdash;he seemed to me a little too harsh, rigid, and 
unsympathising.&nbsp; Now, judgment, sense, principle are invaluable and 
quite indispensable points, but one would be thankful for a <i>little</i> 
feeling, a <i>little</i> indulgence in addition&mdash;without these, poor 
fallible human nature shrinks under the domination of the sterner 
qualities.&nbsp; I answered Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s letter by the mail of the 
19th November, sending it direct, for, on reflection, I did not see why I 
should trouble you with it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did your son Frank call on Mrs. Gaskell? and how did he like 
her?</p>
<p>&lsquo;My health has not been very satisfactory lately, but I think, 
though I vary almost daily, I am much better than I was a fortnight 
ago.&nbsp; All the winter the fact of my never being able to stoop over a 
desk without bringing on pain and oppression in the chest has been a great 
affliction to me, and the want of tranquil rest at night has tried me much,
but I hope for the better times.&nbsp; The doctors say that there is no 
organic mischief.</p>

something of his spring <!-- page 323--><a name="page323"></a><span

greatly ameliorated form, very different to what it has been for three 
years past.&nbsp; I do trust it may pass off thus mildly.&nbsp; I continue 
better.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Nell, I told you from the beginning that my going to Sussex 
was a most improbable event; I tell you now that unless want of health 
should absolutely compel me to give up work and leave home (which I trust 
and hope will not be the case) I <i>certainly shall not think of 
going</i>.&nbsp; It is better to be decided, and decided I must be.&nbsp; 
You can never want me less than when in Sussex surrounded by amusement and 
friends.&nbsp; I do not know that I shall go to Scarbro&rsquo;, but it 
might be possible to spare a fortnight to go there (for the sake of a sad 
duty rather than pleasure), when I could not give a month to a longer 
excursion.&nbsp; I have not a word of news to tell you.&nbsp; Many mails 
have come from India since I was at Brookroyd.&nbsp; Expectation would at 
times be on the alert, but disappointment knocked her down.&nbsp; I have 
not heard a syllable, and cannot think of making inquiries at 
Cornhill.&nbsp; Well, long suspense in any matter usually proves somewhat 
cankering, but God orders all things for us, and to His Will we must 
submit.&nbsp; Be sure to keep a calm mind; expect nothing.&mdash;Yours 
faithfully,</p>

<p>When Mr. Taylor returned to England in 1856 Charlotte Bront&euml; was 
dead.&nbsp; His after-life was more successful than happy.&nbsp; He did 
not, it is true, succeed in Bombay with the firm of Smith, Taylor &amp; 
Co.&nbsp; That would seem to have collapsed.&nbsp; But he made friends in 
Bombay and returned there in 1863 as editor of the <i>Bombay Gazette</i> 
and the <i>Bombay Quarterly Review</i>.&nbsp; A little later he became 
editor of the <i>Bombay Saturday Review</i>, which had not, however, a long
career.&nbsp; Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s successes were not journalistic but 
mercantile.&nbsp; As Secretary of the Bombay Chamber of Commerce, which 
appointment he obtained in 1865, he obtained much real distinction.&nbsp; 
To this post he added that of Registrar of the University of Bombay and 
many other offices.&nbsp; He was elected Sheriff in 1874, in which year he 
died.&nbsp; An imposing funeral ceremony took place <!-- page 324--><a 
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>in the Cathedral, and
he was buried in the Bombay cemetery, where his tomb may be found to the 
left of the entrance gates, inscribed&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JAMES TAYLOR.&nbsp; DIED APRIL 29, 1874, AGED 57.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He married during his visit to England, but the marriage was not a happy
one.&nbsp; That does not belong to the present story.&nbsp; Here, however, 
is a cutting from the <i>Times</i> marriage record in 1863:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;On the 23rd inst., at the Church of St. John the Evangelist, St. 
Pancras, by the Rev. James Moorhouse, M.A., James Taylor, Esq., of 
Furnival&rsquo;s-inn, and Bombay, to Annie, widow of Adolph Ritter, of 
Vienna, and stepdaughter of Thos. Harrison, Esq., of Birchanger Place, 
Essex.&rsquo;</p>

325</span>CHAPTER XIII: LITERARY AMBITIONS</h2>
<p>We have seen how Charlotte Bront&euml; and her sisters wrote from their 
earliest years those little books which embodied their vague aspirations 
after literary fame.&nbsp; Now and again the effort is admirable, notably 
in <i>The Adventures of Ernest Alembert</i>, but on the whole it amounts to
as little as did the juvenile productions of Shelley.&nbsp; That poet, it 
will be remembered, wrote <i>Zastrozzi</i> at nineteen, and much else that 
was bad, some of which he printed.&nbsp; Charlotte Bront&euml; was 
mercifully restrained by a well-nigh empty purse from this ill-considered 
rashness.&nbsp; It was not till the death of their aunt had added to their 
slender resources that the Bront&euml; girls conceived the idea of actually
publishing a book at their own expense.&nbsp; They communicated with the 
now extinct firm of Aylott &amp; Jones of Paternoster Row, and Charlotte 
appears to have written many letters to the firm, <a 
name="citation325"></a><a href="#footnote325" class="citation">[325]</a> 
only two or three of which are printed by Mrs. Gaskell.&nbsp; The 
correspondence is comparatively insignificant, but as the practical 
beginning of Charlotte&rsquo;s literary career, the hitherto unpublished 
letters which have been preserved are perhaps worth reproducing here.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>January</i> 28<i>th</i>, 1846.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;May I request to be 
informed whether you <!-- page 326--><a name="page326"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 326</span>would undertake the publication of a 
collection of short poems in one volume, 8vo.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you object to publishing the work at your own risk, would you 
undertake it on the author&rsquo;s account?&mdash;I am, gentlemen, your 
obedient humble servant,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;I send a draft for 
&pound;31, 10s., being the amount of your estimate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose there is nothing now to prevent your immediately 
commencing the printing of the work.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you acknowledge the receipt of the draft, will you state how
soon it will be completed?&mdash;I am, gentlemen, yours truly,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;I have received the 
proof-sheet, and return it corrected.&nbsp; If there is any doubt at all 
about the printer&rsquo;s competency to correct errors, I would prefer 
submitting each sheet to the inspection of the authors, because such a 
mistake, for instance, as <i>tumbling</i> stars, instead of 
<i>trembling</i>, would suffice to throw an air of absurdity over a whole 
poem; but if you know from experience that he is to be relied on, I would 
trust to your assurance on the subject, and leave the task of correction to
him, as I know that a considerable saving both of time and trouble would be
thus effected.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The printing and paper appear to me satisfactory.&nbsp; Of course
I wish to have the work out as soon as possible, but I am still more 
anxious that it should be got up in a manner creditable to the publishers 
and agreeable to the authors.&mdash;I am, gentlemen, yours truly,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;C., E., and A. Bell 
are now preparing for the press a work of fiction, consisting of three 
distinct and unconnected tales, which may be published either together, as 
a work of three volumes, of the ordinary novel size, or separately as 
single volumes, as shall be deemed most advisable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not their intention to publish these tales on their own 
account.&nbsp; They direct me to ask you whether you would be disposed to 
undertake the work, after having, of course, by due inspection of the Ms., 
ascertained that its contents are such as to warrant an expectation of 
success.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An early answer will oblige, as, in case of your negativing the 
proposal, inquiry must be made of other publishers.&mdash;I am, gentlemen,

value to us, <!-- page 328--><a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

prepare.&nbsp; It appears the volume will be a thinner one than was 
calculated on.&mdash;I am, gentlemen, yours truly,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;The books may be done
up in the style of Moxon&rsquo;s duodecimo edition of Wordsworth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The price may be fixed at 5s., or if you think that too much for 
the size of the volume, say 4s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think the periodicals I mentioned in my last will be sufficient
for advertising in at present, and I should not wish you to lay out a 
larger sum than &pound;2, especially as the estimate is increased by nearly
&pound;5, in consequence, it appears, of a mistake.&nbsp; I should think 
the success of a work depends more on the notice it receives from 
periodicals, than on the quantity of advertisements.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you do not object, the additional amount of the estimate can 
be remitted when you send in your account at the end of the first six 
months.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should be obliged to you if you could let me know how soon 
copies can be sent to the editors of the magazines and newspapers 
specified.&mdash;I am, gentlemen, yours truly,</p>

sum necessary to defray the entire expense of paper and printing.&nbsp; It 
will leave a small surplus of 11s. 9d., which you can place to my 
account.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad you have sent copies to the newspapers you mention, and
in case of a notice favourable or otherwise appearing in them, or in any of
the other periodicals to which <!-- page 329--><a name="page329"></a><span

you if you would send me down the numbers; otherwise, I have not the 
opportunity of seeing these publications regularly.&nbsp; I might miss it, 
and should the poems be remarked upon favourably, it is my intention to 
appropriate a further sum to advertisements.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, 
they should pass unnoticed or be condemned, I consider it would be quite 
useless to advertise, as there is nothing, either in the title of the work 
or the names of the authors, to attract attention from a single 
individual.&mdash;I am, gentlemen, yours truly,</p>

<p><!-- page 331--><a name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

distribution to any appreciable extent, as a considerable 
&lsquo;remainder&rsquo; appear to have been bound up with a new title-page 
by Smith &amp; Elder.&nbsp; With this Smith &amp; Elder title-page, the 
book is not uncommon, whereas, with the Aylott &amp; Jones title-page it is
exceedingly rare.&nbsp; Perhaps there were a dozen review copies and a 
dozen presentation copies, in addition to the two that were sold, but only

<p>We see by the letter to Aylott &amp; Jones the first announcement of 
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>, <i>Agnes Grey</i>, and <i>The 
Professor</i>.&nbsp; It would not seem that there was much, or indeed any, 
difficulty in disposing of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Agnes 
Grey</i>.&nbsp; They bear the imprint of Newby of Mortimer Street, and they
appeared in three uniform volumes, the two first being taken up by 
<i>Wuthering Heights</i>, and the third <!-- page 332--><a 
name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>by <i>Agnes Grey</i>,
<a name="citation332a"></a><a href="#footnote332a" 
class="citation">[332a]</a> which is quaintly marked as if it were a 
three-volumed novel in itself, having &lsquo;Volume III&rsquo; on 
title-page and binding.&nbsp; I have said that there were no travels before
the manuscripts of Emily and Anne.&nbsp; That is not quite certain.&nbsp; 
Mrs. Gaskell implies that there were; but, at any rate, there is no 
definite information on the subject.&nbsp; Newby, it is clear, did not 
publish them until all the world was discussing <i>Jane Eyre</i>.&nbsp; 
<i>The Professor</i>, by Currer Bell, had, however, travel enough!&nbsp; It
was offered to six publishers in succession before it came into the hands 
of Mr. W. S. Williams, the &lsquo;reader&rsquo; for Smith &amp; 
Elder.&nbsp; The circumstance of its courteous refusal by that firm, and 
the suggestion that a three-volumed novel would be gladly considered, are 
within the knowledge of all Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s admirers. <a

<p>One cannot but admire the fearless and uncompromising honesty with which
Charlotte Bront&euml; sent the MSS. round with all its previous journeys 
frankly indicated.</p>
<p>It is not easy at this time of day to understand why Mr. Williams 
refused <i>The Professor</i>.&nbsp; The story is incomparably superior to 
the average novel, and, indeed, contains touches which are equal to 
anything that Currer Bell ever wrote.&nbsp; It seems to me possible that 
Charlotte Bront&euml; rewrote the story after its rejection, but the 
manuscript does not bear out that impression. <a name="citation332c"></a><a

page 333--><a name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>of 
cardboard&mdash;the broken cover of a book, in fact&mdash;and a few sheets 
of note-paper, and write her first form of a story upon these sheets in a 
tiny handwriting in pencil.&nbsp; She would afterwards copy the whole out 
upon quarto paper very neatly in ink.&nbsp; None of the original pencilled 
MSS.&nbsp; of her greater novels have been preserved.&nbsp; The extant 
manuscripts of <i>Jane Eyre</i> and <i>The Professor</i> are in ink.</p>
<p><i>Jane Eyre</i> was written, then, under Mr. Williams&rsquo;s kind 
encouragement, and immediately accepted.&nbsp; It was published in the 
first week of October 1847.</p>
<p>The following letters were received by Mr. Williams while the book was 
beginning its course.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>October</i> 4<i>th</i>, 1847.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I thank you sincerely 
for your last letter.&nbsp; It is valuable to me because it furnishes me 
with a sound opinion on points respecting which I desired to be advised; be
assured I shall do what I can to profit by your wise and good counsel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Permit me, however, sir, to caution you against forming too 
favourable an idea of my powers, or too sanguine an expectation of what 
they can achieve.&nbsp; I am myself sensible both of deficiencies of 
capacity and disadvantages of circumstance which will, I fear, render it 
somewhat difficult for me to attain popularity as an author.&nbsp; The 
eminent writers you mention&mdash;Mr. Thackeray, Mr. Dickens, Mrs. Marsh, 
<a name="citation333"></a><a href="#footnote333" class="citation">[333]</a>
etc., doubtless enjoyed facilities for observation such as I have not; 
certainly they possess a knowledge of the world, whether intuitive or 
acquired, such as I can lay no claim to, and this gives their <!-- page 
334--><a name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>writings an 
importance and a variety greatly beyond what I can offer the public.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still, if health be spared and time vouchsafed me, I mean to do 
my best; and should a moderate success crown my efforts, its value will be 
greatly enhanced by the proof it will seem to give that your kind counsel 
and encouragement have not been bestowed on one quite unworthy.&mdash;Yours
respectfully,</p>

<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>October</i> 9<i>th</i>, 1847.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I do not know whether 
the <i>Dublin University Magazine</i> is included in the list of 
periodicals to which Messrs. Smith &amp; Elder are accustomed to send 
copies of new publications, but as a former work, the joint production of 
myself and my two relatives, Ellis and Acton Bell, received a somewhat 
favourable notice in that magazine, it appears to me that if the 
editor&rsquo;s attention were drawn to <i>Jane Eyre</i> he might possibly 
bestow on it also a few words of remark.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The<i> Critic</i> and the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> also gave 
comments on the work I allude to.&nbsp; The review in the first-mentioned 
paper was unexpectedly and generously eulogistic, that in the 
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> more qualified, but still not discouraging.&nbsp; I 
mention these circumstances and leave it to you to judge whether any 
advantage is derivable from them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You dispensed me from the duty of answering your last letter, but
my sense of the justness of the views it expresses will not permit me to 
neglect this opportunity both of acknowledging it and thanking you for 
it.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>

<i>December</i> 13<i>th</i>, 1847.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your advice merits and
shall have my most serious attention.&nbsp; I feel the force of your 
reasoning.&nbsp; It is my wish to do my best in the career on which I have 
entered.&nbsp; <!-- page 335--><a name="page335"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 335</span>So I shall study and strive; and by dint of 
time, thought, and effort, I hope yet to deserve in part the encouragement 
you and others have so generously accorded me.&nbsp; But time will be 
necessary&mdash;that I feel more than ever.&nbsp; In case of <i>Jane 
Eyre</i> reaching a second edition, I should wish some few corrections to 
be made, and will prepare an errata.&nbsp; How would the accompanying 
preface do?&nbsp; I thought it better to be brief.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The <i>Observer</i> has just reached me.&nbsp; I always compel 
myself to read the analysis in every newspaper-notice.&nbsp; It is a just 
punishment, a due though severe humiliation for faults of plan and 
construction.&nbsp; I wonder if the analysis of other fictions read as 
absurdly as that of <i>Jane Eyre</i> always does.&mdash;I am, dear sir, 
yours respectfully,</p>

<p>The following letter is interesting because it discusses the rejected 
novel, and refers to the project of recasting it, which ended in the 
writing of <i>Villette</i>. <a name="citation335"></a><a

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>December</i> 14<i>th</i>, 1847.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have just received 
your kind and welcome letter of the 11th.&nbsp; I shall proceed at once to 
discuss the principal subject of it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course a second work has occupied my thoughts much.&nbsp; I 
think it would be premature in me to undertake a serial now&mdash;I am not 
yet qualified for the task: I have neither gained a sufficiently firm 
footing with the public, nor do I possess sufficient confidence in myself, 
nor can I boast those unflagging animal spirits, that even command of the 
faculty of composition, which as you say, and, I am persuaded, most justly,
is an indispensable requisite to success in serial literature.&nbsp; I 
decidedly feel that ere I change my ground I had better make another 
venture in the three volume novel form.</p>
<p><!-- page 336--><a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
336</span>&lsquo;Respecting the plan of such a work, I have pondered it, 
but as yet with very unsatisfactory results.&nbsp; Three commencements have
I essayed, but all three displease me.&nbsp; A few days since I looked over
<i>The Professor</i>.&nbsp; I found the beginning very feeble, the whole 
narrative deficient in incident and in general attractiveness.&nbsp; Yet 
the middle and latter portion of the work, all that relates to Brussels, 
the Belgian school, etc., is as good as I can write: it contains more pith,
more substance, more reality, in my judgment, than much of <i>Jane 
Eyre</i>.&nbsp; It gives, I think, a new view of a grade, an occupation, 
and a class of characters&mdash;all very commonplace, very insignificant in
themselves, but not more so than the materials composing that portion of 
<i>Jane Eyre</i> which seems to please most generally.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My wish is to recast <i>The Professor</i>, add as well as I can 
what is deficient, retrench some parts, develop others, and make of it a 
three volume work&mdash;no easy task, I know, yet I trust not an 
impracticable one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not forgotten that <i>The Professor</i> was set aside in 
my agreement with Messrs. Smith &amp; Elder; therefore before I take any 
step to execute the plan I have sketched, I should wish to have your 
judgment on its wisdom.&nbsp; You read or looked over the Ms.&mdash;what 
impression have you now respecting its worth? and what confidence have you 
that I can make it better than it is?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Feeling certain that from business reasons as well as from 
natural integrity you will be quite candid with me, I esteem it a privilege
to be able thus to consult you.&mdash;Believe me, dear sir, yours 
respectfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. Bell</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Wuthering Heights</i> is, I suppose, at length published, at 
least Mr. Newby has sent the authors their six copies.&nbsp; I wonder how 
it will be received.&nbsp; I should say it merits the epithets of 
&ldquo;vigorous&rdquo; and &ldquo;original&rdquo; much more decidedly than 
<i>Jane Eyre</i> did.&nbsp; <i>Agnes Grey</i> should please such critics as
Mr. Lewes, for it is &ldquo;true&rdquo; and &ldquo;unexaggerated&rdquo; 
enough.&nbsp; The books are not well got up&mdash;they abound in errors of 
the <!-- page 337--><a name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
337</span>press.&nbsp; On a former occasion I expressed myself with perhaps
too little reserve regarding Mr. Newby, yet I cannot but feel, and feel 
painfully, that Ellis and Acton have not had the justice at his hands that 
I have had at those of Messrs. Smith &amp; Elder.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>December</i> 31<i>st</i>, 1847.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sirs</span>,&mdash;I think, for the 
reasons you mention, it is better to substitute <i>author</i> for 
<i>editor</i>.&nbsp; I should not be ashamed to be considered the author of
<i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Agnes Grey</i>, but, possessing no real 
claim to that honour, I would rather not have it attributed to me, thereby 
depriving the true authors of their just meed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You do very rightly and very kindly to tell me the objections 
made against <i>Jane Eyre</i>&mdash;they are more essential than the 
praises.&nbsp; I feel a sort of heart-ache when I hear the book called 
&ldquo;godless&rdquo; and &ldquo;pernicious&rdquo; by good and 
earnest-minded men; but I know that heart-ache will be salutary&mdash;at 
least I trust so.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is meant by the charges of <i>trickery</i> and 
<i>artifice</i> I have yet to comprehend.&nbsp; It was no art in me to 
write a tale&mdash;it was no trick in Messrs. Smith &amp; Elder to publish 
it.&nbsp; Where do the trickery and artifice lie?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have received the <i>Scotsman</i>, and was greatly amused to 
see Jane Eyre likened to Rebecca Sharp&mdash;the resemblance would hardly 
have occurred to me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish to send this note by to-day&rsquo;s post, and must 
therefore conclude in haste.&mdash;I am, dear sir, yours respectfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. 
Bell</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>January</i> 4<i>th</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letter made me 
ashamed of myself that I should ever have uttered a murmur, or expressed by
any sign that I was sensible of pain from the unfavourable opinions of <!--
page 338--><a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 338</span>some 
misjudging but well-meaning people.&nbsp; But, indeed, let me assure you, I
am not ungrateful for the kindness which has been given me in such abundant
measure.&nbsp; I can discriminate the proportions in which blame and praise
have been awarded to my efforts: I see well that I have had less of the 
former and more of the latter than I merit.&nbsp; I am not therefore 
crushed, though I may be momentarily saddened by the frown, even of the 
good.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would take a great deal to crush me, because I know, in the 
first place, that my own intentions were correct, that I feel in my heart a
deep reverence for religion, that impiety is very abhorrent to me; and in 
the second, I place firm reliance on the judgment of some who have 
encouraged me.&nbsp; You and Mr. Lewes are quite as good authorities, in my
estimation, as Mr. Dilke or the editor of the <i>Spectator</i>, and I would
not under any circumstances, or for any opprobrium, regard with shame what 
my friends had approved&mdash;none but a coward would let the detraction of
an enemy outweigh the encouragement of a friend.&nbsp; You must not, 
therefore, fulfil your threat of being less communicative in future; you 
must kindly tell me all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Kavanagh&rsquo;s view of the maniac coincides with Leigh 
Hunt&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I agree with them that the character is shocking, but I
know that it is but too natural.&nbsp; There is a phase of insanity which 
may be called moral madness, in which all that is good or even human seems 
to disappear from the mind, and a fiend-nature replaces it.&nbsp; The sole 
aim and desire of the being thus possessed is to exasperate, to molest, to 
destroy, and preternatural ingenuity and energy are often exercised to that
dreadful end.&nbsp; The aspect, in such cases, assimilates with the 
disposition&mdash;all seem demonized.&nbsp; It is true that profound pity 
ought to be the only sentiment elicited by the view of such degradation, 
and equally true is it that I have not sufficiently dwelt on that feeling: 
I have erred in making <i>horror</i> too predominant.&nbsp; Mrs. Rochester,
indeed, lived a sinful life before she was insane, but sin is itself a 
species of insanity&mdash;the truly good behold and compassionate it as 
such.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>Jane Eyre</i> has got down into Yorkshire, a copy has even 
<!-- page 339--><a name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
339</span>penetrated into this neighbourhood.&nbsp; I saw an elderly 
clergyman reading it the other day, and had the satisfaction of hearing him
exclaim, &ldquo;Why, they have got --- School, and Mr. --- here, I declare!
and Miss ---&rdquo; (naming the originals of Lowood, Mr. Brocklehurst and 
Miss Temple).&nbsp; He had known them all.&nbsp; I wondered whether he 
would recognise the portraits, and was gratified to find that he did, and 
that, moreover, he pronounced them faithful and just.&nbsp; He said, too, 
that Mr. --- (Brocklehurst) &ldquo;deserved the chastisement he had 
got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He did not recognise Currer Bell.&nbsp; What author would be 
without the advantage of being able to walk invisible?&nbsp; One is thereby
enabled to keep such a quiet mind.&nbsp; I make this small observation in 
confidence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What makes you say that the notice in the <i>Westminster 
Review</i> is not by Mr. Lewes?&nbsp; It expresses precisely his opinions, 
and he said he would perhaps insert a few lines in that periodical.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have sometimes thought that I ought to have written to Mr. 
Lewes to thank him for his review in <i>Fraser</i>; and, indeed, I did 
write a note, but then it occurred to me that he did not require the 
author&rsquo;s thanks, and I feared it would be superfluous to send it, 
therefore I refrained; however, though I have not <i>expressed</i> 
gratitude I have <i>felt</i> it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you, too, <i>many many</i> happy new years, and prosperity
and success to you and yours.&mdash;Believe me, etc.,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Currer 
Bell</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have received the <i>Courier</i> and the <i>Oxford 
Chronicle</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>January</i> 22<i>nd</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have received the 
<i>Morning Herald</i>, and was much pleased with the notice, chiefly on 
account of the reference made to that portion of the preface which concerns
Messrs. Smith &amp; Elder.&nbsp; If my tribute of thanks can benefit my 
publishers, it is desirable that it should have as much publicity as 
possible.</p>
<p><!-- page 340--><a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
340</span>&lsquo;I do not know if the part which relates to Mr. Thackeray 
is likely to be as well received; but whether generally approved of and 
understood or not, I shall not regret having written it, for I am convinced
of its truth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I see I was mistaken in my idea that the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> 
and others wished to ascribe the authorship of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> to 
Currer Bell; the contrary is the case, <i>Jane Eyre</i> is given to Ellis 
Bell; and Mr. Newby, it appears, thinks it expedient so to frame his 
advertisements as to favour the misapprehension.&nbsp; If Mr. Newby had 
much sagacity he would see that Ellis Bell is strong enough to stand 
without being propped by Currer Bell, and would have disdained what Ellis 
himself of all things disdains&mdash;recourse to trickery.&nbsp; However, 
Ellis, Acton, and Currer care nothing for the matter personally; the public
and the critics are welcome to confuse our identities as much as they 
choose; my only fear is lest Messrs. Smith &amp; Elder should in some way 
be annoyed by it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was much interested in your account of Miss Kavanagh.&nbsp; The
character you sketch belongs to a class I peculiarly esteem: one in which 
endurance combines with exertion, talent with goodness; where genius is 
found unmarred by extravagance, self-reliance unalloyed by 
self-complacency.&nbsp; It is a character which is, I believe, rarely found
except where there has been toil to undergo and adversity to struggle 
against: it will only grow to perfection in a poor soil and in the shade; 
if the soil be too indigent, the shade too dank and thick, of course it 
dies where it sprung.&nbsp; But I trust this will not be the case with Miss
Kavanagh.&nbsp; I trust she will struggle ere long into the sunshine.&nbsp;
In you she has a kind friend to direct her, and I hope her mother will live
to see the daughter, who yields to her such childlike duty, both happy and 
successful.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You asked me if I should like any copies of the second edition of
<i>Jane Eyre</i>, and I said&mdash;no.&nbsp; It is true I do not want any 
for myself or my acquaintances, but if the request be not unusual, I should
much like one to be given to Miss Kavanagh.&nbsp; If you would have the 
goodness, you might write on the fly-leaf that the book is presented with 
the author&rsquo;s best <!-- page 341--><a name="page341"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 341</span>wishes for her welfare here and 
hereafter.&nbsp; My reason for wishing that she should have a copy is 
because she said the book had been to her a <i>suggestive</i> one, and I 
know that suggestive books are valuable to authors.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am truly sorry to hear that Mr. Smith has had an attack of the 
prevalent complaint, but I trust his recovery is by this time 
complete.&nbsp; I cannot boast entire exemption from its ravages, as I now 
write under its depressing influence.&nbsp; Hoping that you have been more 
fortunate,&mdash;I am, dear sir, yours faithfully,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>March</i> 3<i>rd</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have received the
<i>Christian Remembrancer</i>, and read the review.&nbsp; It is written 
with some ability; but to do justice was evidently not the critic&rsquo;s 
main object, therefore he excuses himself from performing that duty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I daresay the reviewer imagines that Currer Bell ought to be 
extremely afflicted, very much cut up, by some smart things he 
says&mdash;this however is not the case.&nbsp; C. Bell is on the whole 
rather encouraged than dispirited by the review: the hard-wrung praise 
extorted reluctantly from a foe is the most precious praise of 
all&mdash;you are sure that this, at least, has no admixture of 
flattery.&nbsp; I fear he has too high an opinion of my abilities and of 
what I can do; but that is his own fault.&nbsp; In other respects, he aims 
his shafts in the dark, and the success, or, rather, ill-success of his 
hits makes me laugh rather than cry.&nbsp; His shafts of sarcasm are nicely
polished, keenly pointed; he should not have wasted them in shooting at a 
mark he cannot see.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope such reviews will not make much difference with me, and 
that if the spirit moves me in future to say anything about priests, etc., 
I shall say it with the same freedom as heretofore.&nbsp; I hope also that 
their anger will not make <i>me</i> angry.&nbsp; As a body, I had no 
ill-will against them to begin with, and I feel it would be an error to let
opposition engender such ill-will.&nbsp; A few individuals may possibly be 
called upon to sit for their portraits <!-- page 342--><a

<p>It seems that Mr. Williams had hinted that Charlotte might like to 
emulate Thackeray by illustrating her own books.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>March</i> 11<i>th</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have just received 
the copy of the second edition, and will look over it, and send the 
corrections as soon as possible; I will also, since you think it advisable,
avail myself of the opportunity of a third edition to correct the mistake 
respecting the authorship of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Agnes 
Grey</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to your second suggestion, it is, one can see at a glance, a 
very judicious and happy one; but I cannot adopt it, because I have not the
skill you attribute to me.&nbsp; It is not enough to have the 
artist&rsquo;s eye, one must also have the artist&rsquo;s hand to turn the 
first gift to practical account.&nbsp; I have, in my day, wasted a certain 
quantity of Bristol board and drawing-paper, crayons and cakes of colour, 
but when I examine the contents of my portfolio now, it seems as if during 
the years it has been lying closed some fairy had changed what I once 
thought sterling coin into dry leaves, and I feel much inclined to consign 
the whole collection of drawings to the fire; I see they have no 
value.&nbsp; If, then, <i>Jane Eyre</i> is ever to be illustrated, it must 
be by some other hand than that of its author.&nbsp; But I hope no one will
be at the trouble to make portraits of my characters.&nbsp; Bulwer and 
Byron heroes and heroines are very well, they are all of them handsome; but
my personages are mostly unattractive in look, and therefore ill-adapted to
figure in ideal portraits.&nbsp; At the best, I have always thought such 
representations futile.&nbsp; You will not easily find a second 
Thackeray.&nbsp; How he can render, with a few black lines and dots, shades
of expression so fine, so real; traits of character so minute, so subtle, 
so difficult to seize and fix, I cannot tell&mdash;I <!-- page 343--><a 
name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 343</span>can only wonder and 
admire.&nbsp; Thackeray may not be a painter, but he is a wizard of a 
draughtsman; touched with his pencil, paper lives.&nbsp; And then his 
drawing is so refreshing; after the wooden limbs one is accustomed to see 
pourtrayed by commonplace illustrators, his shapes of bone and muscle 
clothed with flesh, correct in proportion and anatomy, are a real 
relief.&nbsp; All is true in Thackeray.&nbsp; If Truth were again a 
goddess, Thackeray should be her high priest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I read my preface over with some pain&mdash;I did not like 
it.&nbsp; I wrote it when I was a little enthusiastic, like you, about the 
French Revolution.&nbsp; I wish I had written it in a cool moment; I should
have said the same things, but in a different manner.&nbsp; One may be as 
enthusiastic as one likes about an author who has been dead a century or 
two, but I see it is a fault to bore the public with enthusiasm about a 
living author.&nbsp; I promise myself to take better care in future.&nbsp; 
<i>Still</i> I will <i>think</i> as I please.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are the London republicans, and <i>you</i> amongst the number, 
cooled down yet?&nbsp; I suppose not, because your French brethren are 
acting very nobly.&nbsp; The abolition of slavery and of the punishment of 
death for political offences are two glorious deeds, but how will they get 
over the question of the organisation of labour!&nbsp; Such theories will 
be the sand-bank on which their vessel will run aground if they don&rsquo;t
mind.&nbsp; Lamartine, there is not doubt, would make an excellent 
legislator for a nation of Lamartines&mdash;but where is that nation?&nbsp;
I hope these observations are sceptical and cool enough.&mdash;Believe me,

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>November</i> 16<i>th</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sirs</span>,&mdash;I have already 
acknowledged in a note to Mr. Smith the receipt of the parcel of books, and
in my thanks for this well-timed attention I am sure I ought to include 
you; your taste, I thought, was recognisable in the choice of some of the 
volumes, and a better selection it would have been difficult to make.</p>
<p><!-- page 344--><a name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
344</span>&lsquo;To-day I have received the <i>Spectator</i> and the 
<i>Revue des deux Mondes</i>.&nbsp; The <i>Spectator</i> consistently 
maintains the tone it first assumed regarding the Bells.&nbsp; I have 
little to object to its opinion as far as Currer Bell&rsquo;s portion of 
the volume is concerned.&nbsp; It is true the critic sees only the faults, 
but for these his perception is tolerably accurate.&nbsp; Blind is he as 
any bat, insensate as any stone, to the merits of Ellis.&nbsp; He cannot 
feel or will not acknowledge that the very finish and <i>labor 
lim&aelig;</i> which Currer wants, Ellis has; he is not aware that the 
&ldquo;true essence of poetry&rdquo; pervades his compositions.&nbsp; 
Because Ellis&rsquo;s poems are short and abstract, the critics think them 
comparatively insignificant and dull.&nbsp; They are mistaken.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The notice in the <i>Revue des deux Mondes</i> is one of the most
able, the most acceptable to the author, of any that has yet 
appeared.&nbsp; Eug&egrave;ne For&ccedil;ade understood and enjoyed <i>Jane
Eyre</i>.&nbsp; I cannot say that of all who have professed to criticise 
it.&nbsp; The censures are as well-founded as the commendations.&nbsp; The 
specimens of the translation given are on the whole good; now and then the 
meaning of the original has been misapprehended, but generally it is well 
rendered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Every cup given us to taste in this life is mixed.&nbsp; Once it 
would have seemed to me that an evidence of success like that contained in 
the <i>Revue</i> would have excited an almost exultant feeling in my 
mind.&nbsp; It comes, however, at a time when counteracting circumstances 
keep the balance of the emotions even&mdash;when my sister&rsquo;s 
continued illness darkens the present and dims the future.&nbsp; That will 
seem to me a happy day when I can announce to you that Emily is

a contrary one will never lead to happiness; and I <!-- page 345--><a

reward of seeing you and her mother pleased must be so sweet that she will 
be careful not to run the risk of forfeiting it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is somewhat singular that I had already observed to my

<p style="text-align: center">TO JAMES TAYLOR, CORNHILL</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>March</i> 1<i>st</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The parcel arrived 
on Saturday evening.&nbsp; Permit me to express my sense of the judgment 
and kindness which have dictated the selection of its contents.&nbsp; They 
appear to be all good books, and good books are, we know, the best 
substitute for good society; if circumstances debar me from the latter 
privilege, the kind attentions of my friends supply me with ample measure 
of the former.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you for your remarks on <i>Shirley</i>.&nbsp; Some of your 
strictures tally with some by Mr. Williams.&nbsp; You both complain of the 
want of distinctness and impressiveness in my heroes.&nbsp; Probably you 
are right.&nbsp; In delineating male character I labour under 
disadvantages: intuition and theory will not always adequately supply the 
place of observation and experience.&nbsp; When I write about women I am 
sure of my ground&mdash;in the other case, I am not so sure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here, then, each of you has laid the critical finger on a point 
that by its shrinking confesses its vulnerability; whether the 
disapprobation you intimate respecting the Briarchapel scenes, the curates,
etc., be equally merited, time will show.&nbsp; I am well aware what will 
be the author&rsquo;s present meed for these passages: I anticipate general
blame and no praise.&nbsp; And were my motive-principle in writing a thirst
for popularity, or were the chief check on my pen a dread of censure, I 
should <!-- page 346--><a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
346</span>withdraw these scenes&mdash;or rather, I should never have 
written them.&nbsp; I will not say whether the considerations that really 
govern me are sound, or whether my convictions are just; but such as they 
are, to their influence I must yield submission.&nbsp; They forbid me to 
sacrifice truth to the fear of blame.&nbsp; I accept their prohibition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With the sincere expression of my esteem for the candour by which
your critique is distinguished,&mdash;I am, my dear sir, yours 
sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. 
Bront&euml;</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>August</i> 16<i>th</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Since I last wrote 
to you I have been getting on with my book as well as I can, and I think I 
may now venture to say that in a few weeks I hope to have the pleasure of 
placing the MS. in the hands of Mr. Smith.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The <i>North British Review</i> duly reached me.&nbsp; I read 
attentively all it says about <i>E. Wyndham</i>, <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and 
<i>F. Hervey</i>.&nbsp; Much of the article is clever, and yet there are 
remarks which&mdash;for me&mdash;rob it of importance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To value praise or stand in awe of blame we must respect the 
source whence the praise and blame proceed, and I do not respect an 
inconsistent critic.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;if <i>Jane Eyre</i> be the 
production of a woman, she must be a woman unsexed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In that case the book is an unredeemed error and should be 
unreservedly condemned.&nbsp; <i>Jane Eyre</i> is a woman&rsquo;s 
autobiography, by a woman it is professedly written.&nbsp; If it is written
as no woman would write, condemn it with spirit and decision&mdash;say it 
is bad, but do not eulogise and then detract.&nbsp; I am reminded of the 
<i>Economist</i>.&nbsp; The literary critic of that paper praised the book 
if written by a man, and pronounced it &ldquo;odious&rdquo; if the work of 
a woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To such critics I would say, &ldquo;To you I am neither man nor 
woman&mdash;I come before you as an author only.&nbsp; It is the sole 
standard by which you have a right to judge me&mdash;the sole ground on 
which I accept your judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a weak comment, having no pretence either to justice 
<!-- page 347--><a name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>or
discrimination, on the works of Ellis and Acton Bell.&nbsp; The critic did 
not know that those writers had passed from time and life.&nbsp; I have 
read no review since either of my sisters died which I could have wished 
<i>them</i> to read&mdash;none even which did not render the thought of 
their departure more tolerable to me.&nbsp; To hear myself praised beyond 
them was cruel, to hear qualities ascribed to them so strangely the reverse
of their real characteristics was scarce supportable.&nbsp; It is sad even 
now; but they are so remote from earth, so safe from its turmoils, I can 
bear it better.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But on one point do I now feel vulnerable: I should grieve to see
my father&rsquo;s peace of mind perturbed on my account; for which reason I
keep my author&rsquo;s existence as much as possible out of his way.&nbsp; 
I have always given him a carefully diluted and modified account of the 
success of <i>Jane Eyre</i>&mdash;just what would please without startling 
him.&nbsp; The book is not mentioned between us once a month.&nbsp; The 
<i>Quarterly</i> I kept to myself&mdash;it would have worried papa.&nbsp; 
To that same <i>Quarterly</i> I must speak in the introduction to my 
present work&mdash;just one little word.&nbsp; You once, I remember, said 
that review was written by a lady&mdash;Miss Rigby.&nbsp; Are you sure of 
this?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give no hint of my intention of discoursing a little with the 
<i>Quarterly</i>.&nbsp; It would look too important to speak of it 
beforehand.&nbsp; All plans are best conceived and executed without 
noise.&mdash;Believe me, yours sincerely,</p>

<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>

very briefly at present&mdash;first to thank you for your interesting 
letter and the graphic description it contained of the neighbourhood where 
you have been staying, and then to decide about the title of the book.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I remember rightly, my Cornhill critics objected to 
<i>Hollow&rsquo;s Mill</i>, nor do I now find it appropriate.&nbsp; It 
might rather be called <i>Fieldhead</i>, though I think <i>Shirley</i> 
would perhaps <!-- page 348--><a name="page348"></a><span

turned out the most prominent and peculiar character in the work.</p>

<p>The famous <i>Quarterly Review</i> article by Miss Rigby, afterwards 
Lady Eastlake, <a name="citation348"></a><a href="#footnote348" 
class="citation">[348]</a> appeared in December 1848, under the title of 
&lsquo;<i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and Governesses.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
It was a review of two novels and a treatise on schools, and but for one or
two offensive passages might have been pronounced fairly 
complimentary.&nbsp; To have coupled <i>Jane Eyre</i> with 
Thackeray&rsquo;s great book, at a time when Thackeray had already reached 
to heroic proportions in the literary world, was in itself a 
compliment.&nbsp; It is small wonder that the speculation was hazarded that
J. G. Lockhart, the editor of the <i>Quarterly</i>, had himself supplied 
the venom.&nbsp; He could display it on occasion.&nbsp; It is quite clear 
now, however, that that was not the case.&nbsp; Miss Rigby was the reviewer
who thought it within a critic&rsquo;s province to suggest that the writer 
might be a woman &lsquo;who had forfeited the society of her 
sex.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lockhart must have read the review hastily, as editors 
will on occasion.&nbsp; He writes to his contributor on November 13, 1848, 
before the article had appeared:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;About three years ago I received a small volume of &lsquo;Poems 
by Currer, Acton, and Ellis Bell,&rsquo; and a queer little note by Currer,
who said the book had been published a year, and just two copies sold, so 
they were to burn the rest, but distributed a few copies, mine being 
one.&nbsp; I find what seems rather a fair review of that tiny tome in the 
<i>Spectator</i> of this week; pray look at it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think the poems of Currer much better than those of Acton and 
Ellis, and believe his novel is vastly better than those which they have 
more recently put forth.</p>
<p><!-- page 349--><a name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
349</span>&lsquo;I know nothing of the writers, but the common rumour is 
that they are brothers of the weaving order in some Lancashire town.&nbsp; 
At first it was generally said Currer was a lady, and Mayfair 
circumstantialised by making her the <i>ch&egrave;re amie</i> of Mr. 
Thackeray.&nbsp; But your skill in &ldquo;dress&rdquo; settles the question
of sex.&nbsp; I think, however, some woman must have assisted in the school
scenes of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, which have a striking air of truthfulness to 
me&mdash;an ignoramus, I allow, on such points.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should say you might as well glance at the novels by Acton and 
Ellis Bell&mdash;<i>Wuthering Heights</i> is one of them.&nbsp; If you have
any friend about Manchester, it would, I suppose, be easy to learn 
accurately as to the position of these men.&rsquo;&nbsp; <a 
name="citation349"></a><a href="#footnote349" 
class="citation">[349]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was written in November, and it was not till December that the 
article appeared.&nbsp; Apart from the offensive imputations upon the 
morals of the author of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, which reduces itself to smart 
impertinence when it is understood that Miss Rigby fully believed that the 
author was a man, the review is not without its compensations for a new 
writer.&nbsp; The &lsquo;equal popularity&rsquo; of <i>Jane Eyre</i> and 
<i>Vanity Fair</i> is referred to.&nbsp; &lsquo;A very remarkable 
book,&rsquo; the reviewer continues; &lsquo;we have no remembrance of 
another containing such undoubted power with such horrid 
taste.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is droll irony, when Charlotte 
Bront&euml;&rsquo;s strong conservative sentiments and church environment 
are considered, in the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;We do not hesitate to say that the tone of mind and thought which
has overthrown authority, and violated every code, human and divine, 
abroad, and fostered chartism and rebellion at home, is the same which has 
also written <i>Jane Eyre</i>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another passage Miss Rigby, musing upon the <!-- page 350--><a 
name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 350</span>masculinity of the 
author, finally clinches her arguments by proofs of a kind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;No woman <i>trusses game</i>, and garnishes dessert dishes with 
the same hands, or talks of so doing in the same breath.&nbsp; Above all, 
no woman attires another in such fancy dresses as Jane&rsquo;s ladies 
assume.&nbsp; Miss Ingram coming down irresistible in a <i>morning</i> robe
of sky-blue crape, a gauze azure scarf twisted in her hair!!&nbsp; No lady,
we understand, when suddenly roused in the night, would think of hurrying 
on &ldquo;a frock.&rdquo;&nbsp; They have garments more convenient for such
occasions, and more becoming too.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Wuthering Heights</i> is described as &lsquo;too odiously and 
abominably pagan to be palatable to the most vitiated class of English 
readers.&rsquo;&nbsp; This no doubt was Miss Rigby&rsquo;s interpolation in
the proofs in reply to her editor&rsquo;s suggestion that she should 
&lsquo;glance at the novels by Acton and Ellis Bell.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is a 
little difficult to understand the <i>Quarterly</i> editor&rsquo;s method, 
or, indeed, the letter to Miss Rigby which I have quoted, as he had formed 
a very different estimate of the book many months before.&nbsp; &lsquo;I 
have finished the adventures of Miss Jane Eyre,&rsquo; he writes to Mrs. 
Hope (Dec. 29th, 1847), &lsquo;and think her far the cleverest that has 
written since Austen and Edgeworth were in their prime, worth fifty 
Trollopes and Martineaus rolled into one counterpane, with fifty Dickenses 
and Bulwers to keep them company&mdash;but rather a brazen Miss.&rsquo; <a 
name="citation350"></a><a href="#footnote350" 
class="citation">[350]</a></p>
<p>When the <i>Quarterly Review</i> appeared, Charlotte Bront&euml;, as we 
have seen, was in dire domestic distress, and it was not till many months 
later, when a new edition of <i>Jane Eyre</i> was projected, that she 
discussed with her publishers the desirability of an effective reply, which
was not however to disclose her sex and environment.&nbsp; A first preface 
called <!-- page 351--><a name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
351</span>&lsquo;A Word to the <i>Quarterly</i>&rsquo; was cancelled, and 
after some debate, the preface which we now have took its place.&nbsp; The 
&lsquo;book&rsquo; is of course <i>Shirley</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>August</i> 29<i>th</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The book is now 
finished (thank God) and ready for Mr. Taylor, but I have not yet heard 
from him.&nbsp; I thought I should be able to tell whether it was equal to 
<i>Jane Eyre</i> or not, but I find I cannot&mdash;it may be better, it may
be worse.&nbsp; I shall be curious to hear your opinion, my own is of no 
value.&nbsp; I send the Preface or &ldquo;Word to the 
<i>Quarterly</i>&rdquo; for your perusal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whatever now becomes of the work, the occupation of writing it 
has been a boon to me.&nbsp; It took me out of dark and desolate reality 
into an unreal but happier region.&nbsp; The worst of it is, my eyes are 
grown somewhat weak and my head somewhat weary and prone to ache with close
work.&nbsp; You can write nothing of value unless you give yourself wholly 
to the theme, and when you so give yourself, you lose appetite and 
sleep&mdash;it cannot be helped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At what time does Mr. Smith intend to bring the book out?&nbsp; 
It is his now.&nbsp; I hand it and all the trouble and care and anxiety

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I cannot change my 
preface.&nbsp; I can shed no tears before the public, nor utter any groan 
in the public ear.&nbsp; The deep, real tragedy of our domestic experience 
is yet terribly fresh in my mind and memory.&nbsp; It is not a time to be 
talked about to the indifferent; it is not a topic for allusion to in 
print.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No righteous indignation can I lavish on the 
<i>Quarterly</i>.&nbsp; I <!-- page 352--><a name="page352"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 352</span>can condescend but to touch it with the 
lightest satire.&nbsp; Believe me, my dear sir, &ldquo;C. 
Bront&euml;&rdquo; must not here appear; what she feels or has felt is not 
the question&mdash;it is &ldquo;Currer Bell&rdquo; who was 
insulted&mdash;he must reply.&nbsp; Let Mr. Smith fearlessly print the 
preface I have sent&mdash;let him depend upon me this once; even if I prove
a broken reed, his fall cannot be dangerous: a preface is a short distance,
it is not three volumes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have always felt certain that it is a deplorable error in an 
author to assume the tragic tone in addressing the public about his own 
wrongs or griefs.&nbsp; What does the public care about him as an 
individual?&nbsp; His wrongs are its sport; his griefs would be a 
bore.&nbsp; What we deeply feel is our own&mdash;we must keep it to 
ourselves.&nbsp; Ellis and Acton Bell were, for me, Emily and Anne; my 
sisters&mdash;to me intimately near, tenderly dear&mdash;to the public they
were nothing&mdash;worse than nothing&mdash;beings speculated upon, 
misunderstood, misrepresented.&nbsp; If I live, the hour may come when the 
spirit will move me to speak of them, but it is not come yet.&mdash;I am,

great pleasure.&nbsp; An author who has showed his book to none, held no 
consultation about plan, subject, characters, or incidents, asked and had 
no opinion from one living being, but fabricated it darkly in the silent 
workshop of his own brain&mdash;such an author awaits with a singular 
feeling the report of the first impression produced by his creation in a 
quarter where he places confidence, and truly glad he is when that report 
proves favourable.</p>

Currer Bell is a woman, or will it favour a contrary opinion?</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your advice is very 
good, and yet I cannot follow it: I <i>cannot</i> alter now.&nbsp; It 
sounds absurd, but so it is.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The circumstances of Shirley&rsquo;s being nervous on such a 
matter may appear incongruous because I fear it is not well managed; 
otherwise it is perfectly natural.&nbsp; In such minds, such odd points, 
such queer unexpected inconsistent weaknesses <i>are</i> 
found&mdash;perhaps there never was an ardent poetic temperament, however 
healthy, quite without them; but they never communicate them unless forced,
they have a suspicion that the terror is absurd, and keep it hidden.&nbsp; 
Still the thing is badly managed, and I bend my head and expect in 
resignation what, <i>here</i>, I know I deserve&mdash;the lash of 
criticism.&nbsp; I shall wince when it falls, but not scream.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are right about Goth, you are very right&mdash;he is clear, 
deep, but very cold.&nbsp; I acknowledge him great, but cannot feel him 
genial.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mention the literary coteries.&nbsp; To speak the truth, I 
recoil from them, though I long to see some of the truly great literary 
characters.&nbsp; However, this is not to be yet&mdash;I cannot sacrifice

presence of a clergyman in the house, and the indisposition of one of our

<p>&lsquo;As you may conjecture, it cheered and pleased me much to learn 
that the opinion of my friends in Cornhill was favourable to 
<i>Shirley</i>&mdash;that, on the whole, it was considered no falling off 
from <i>Jane Eyre</i>.&nbsp; I am trying, however, not to encourage too

the people of the post-office there, and am sure they would not venture on 
such a step; besides, the Haworth people have long since set me down as 
bookish and quiet, and trouble themselves no farther about me.&nbsp; But 
the gossiping inquisitiveness of small towns is rife at Keighley; there 
they are sadly puzzled to guess why I never visit, encourage no overtures

commercial prospects of the work.&nbsp; I try not to be anxious about its 
literary fate; and if I cannot be quite stoical, I think I am still 
tolerably resigned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Lewes does not like the opening chapter, wherein he resembles
you.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have permitted myself the treat of spending the last week with 
my friend Ellen.&nbsp; Her residence is in a far more populous and stirring
neighbourhood than this.&nbsp; Whenever I go there I am unavoidably forced 
into society&mdash;clerical society chiefly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;During my late visit I have too often had reason, sometimes in a 
pleasant, sometimes in a painful form, to fear that I no longer walk 
invisible.&nbsp; <i>Jane Eyre</i>, it appears, has been read all over the 
district&mdash;a fact of which I never dreamt&mdash;a circumstance of which
the possibility never occurred to me.&nbsp; I met sometimes with new 
deference, with augmented kindness: old schoolfellows and old teachers, 
too, greeted me with generous warmth.&nbsp; And again, ecclesiastical brows
lowered thunder at me.&nbsp; When I confronted one or two large-made 
priests, I longed for the battle to come on.&nbsp; I wish they would speak 
out plainly.&nbsp; You must not understand that my schoolfellows and 
teachers were of the Clergy Daughters School&mdash;in fact, I was never 
there but for one little year as a very little girl.&nbsp; I am certain I 
have long been forgotten; though for myself, I remember all and everything 
clearly: early impressions are ineffaceable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have just received the <i>Daily News</i>.&nbsp; Let me speak 
the truth&mdash;when I read it my heart sickened over it.&nbsp; It is not a
good review, it is unutterably false.&nbsp; If <i>Shirley</i> strikes all 
readers as it has struck that one, but&mdash;I shall not say what 
follows.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the whole I am glad a decidedly bad notice has come 
first&mdash;a notice whose inexpressible ignorance first stuns and <!-- 
page 357--><a name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 357</span>then 
stirs me.&nbsp; Are there no such men as the Helstones and Yorkes?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, there are.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is the first chapter disgusting or vulgar?</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>It is not</i>, <i>it is real</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As for the praise of such a critic, I find it silly and nauseous,
and I scorn it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were my sisters now alive they and I would laugh over this 
notice; but they sleep, they will wake no more for me, and I am a fool to 
be so moved by what is not worth a sigh.&mdash;Believe me, yours 
sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;C. B.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must spare me if I seem hasty, I fear I really am not so firm
as I used to be, nor so patient.&nbsp; Whenever any shock comes, I feel 
that almost all supports have been withdrawn.&rsquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>November</i> 5<i>th</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I did not receive 
the parcel of copies till Saturday evening.&nbsp; Everything sent by 
Bradford is long in reaching me.&nbsp; It is, I think, better to direct: 
Keighley.&nbsp; I was very much pleased with the appearance and getting up 
of the book; it looks well.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have got the <i>Examiner</i> and your letter.&nbsp; You are 
very good not to be angry with me, for I wrote in indignation and 
grief.&nbsp; The critic of the <i>Daily News</i> struck me as to the last 
degree incompetent, ignorant, and flippant.&nbsp; A thrill of mutiny went 
all through me when I read his small effusion.&nbsp; To be judged by such a
one revolted me.&nbsp; I ought, however, to have controlled myself, and I 
did not.&nbsp; I am willing to be judged by the <i>Examiner</i>&mdash;I 
like the <i>Examiner</i>.&nbsp; Fonblanque has power, he has 
discernment&mdash;I bend to his censorship, I am grateful for his praise; 
his blame deserves consideration; when he approves, I permit myself a 
moderate emotion of pride.&nbsp; Am I wrong in supposing that critique to 
be written by Mr. Fonblanque?&nbsp; But whether it is by him or Forster, I 
am thankful.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In reading the critiques of the other papers&mdash;when I get 
them&mdash;I will try to follow your advice and preserve my <!-- page 
358--><a name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
358</span>equanimity.&nbsp; But I cannot be sure of doing this, for I had 
good resolutions and intentions before, and, you see, I failed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ask me if I am related to Nelson.&nbsp; No, I never heard 
that I was.&nbsp; The rumour must have originated in our name resembling 
his title.&nbsp; I wonder who that former schoolfellow of mine was that 
told Mr. Lewes, or how she had been enabled to identify Currer Bell with C.
Bront&euml;.&nbsp; She could not have been a Cowan Bridge girl, none of 
them can possibly remember me.&nbsp; They might remember my eldest sister, 
Maria; her prematurely-developed and remarkable intellect, as well as the 
mildness, wisdom, and fortitude of her character might have left an 
indelible impression on some observant mind amongst her companions.&nbsp; 
My second sister, Elizabeth, too, may perhaps be remembered, but I cannot 
conceive that I left a trace behind me.&nbsp; My career was a very quiet 
one.&nbsp; I was plodding and industrious, perhaps I was very grave, for I 
suffered to see my sisters perishing, but I think I was remarkable for 
nothing.&mdash;Believe me, my dear sir, yours sincerely,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have received 
since I wrote last the Globe, Standard of Freedom, Britannia, Economist, 
and Weekly Chronicle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is <i>Shirley</i> getting on, and what is now the general 
feeling respecting the work?</p>
<p>&lsquo;As far as I can judge from the tone of the newspapers, it seems 
that those who were most charmed with <i>Jane Eyre</i> are the least 
pleased with <i>Shirley</i>; they are disappointed at not finding the same 
excitement, interest, stimulus; while those who spoke disparagingly of 
<i>Jane Eyre</i> like <i>Shirley</i> a little better than her 
predecessor.&nbsp; I suppose its dryer matter suits their dryer 
minds.&nbsp; But I feel that the fiat for which I wait does not depend on 
newspapers, except, indeed, such newspapers as the <i>Examiner</i>.&nbsp; 
The monthlies and quarterlies will pronounce it, I suppose.&nbsp; Mere 
novel-readers, it is evident, think <i>Shirley</i> something of a 
failure.&nbsp; Still, the majority of the notices have on the <!-- page 
359--><a name="page359"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 359</span>whole been 
favourable.&nbsp; That in the <i>Standard of Freedom</i> was very kindly 
expressed; and coming from a dissenter, William Howitt, I wonder 
thereat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you satisfied at Cornhill, or the contrary?&nbsp; I have read
part of <i>The Caxtons</i>, and, when I have finished, will tell you what I
think of it; meantime, I should very much like to hear your opinion.&nbsp; 
Perhaps I shall keep mine till I see you, whenever that may be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am trying by degrees to inure myself to the thought of some day
stepping over to Keighley, taking the train to Leeds, thence to London, and
once more venturing to set foot in the strange, busy whirl of the Strand 
and Cornhill.&nbsp; I want to talk to you a little and to hear by word of 
mouth how matters are progressing.&nbsp; Whenever I come, I must come 
quietly and but for a short time&mdash;I should be unhappy to leave papa 
longer than a fortnight.&mdash;Believe me, yours sincerely,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;If it is 
discouraging to an author to see his work mouthed over by the entirely 
ignorant and incompetent, it is equally reviving to hear what you have 
written discussed and analysed by a critic who is master of his 
subject&mdash;by one whose heart feels, whose powers grasp the matter he 
undertakes to handle.&nbsp; Such refreshment Eug&egrave;ne For&ccedil;ade 
has given me.&nbsp; Were I to see that man, my impulse would be to say, 
&ldquo;Monsieur, you know me, I shall deem it an honour to know 
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not find that For&ccedil;ade detects any coarseness in the 
work&mdash;it is for the smaller critics to find that out.&nbsp; The master
in the art&mdash;the subtle-thoughted, keen-eyed, quick-feeling Frenchman, 
knows the true nature of the ingredients which went to the composition of 
the creation he analyses&mdash;he knows the true nature of things, and he 
gives them their right name.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yours of yesterday has just reached me.&nbsp; Let me, in the 
first place, express my sincere sympathy with your anxiety on Mrs. 
Williams&rsquo;s account.&nbsp; I know how sad it is when pain and 
suffering attack those we love, when that mournful guest <!-- page 360--><a
name="page360"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 360</span>sickness comes and 
takes a place in the household circle.&nbsp; That the shadow may soon leave
your home is my earnest hope.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you for Sir J. Herschel&rsquo;s note.&nbsp; I am happy to 
hear Mr. Taylor is convalescent.&nbsp; It may, perhaps, be some weeks yet 
before his hand is well, but that his general health is in the way of 
re-establishment is a matter of thankfulness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;One of the letters you sent to-day addressed &ldquo;Currer 
Bell&rdquo; has almost startled me.&nbsp; The writer first describes his 
family, and then proceeds to give a particular account of himself in 
colours the most candid, if not, to my ideas, the most attractive.&nbsp; He
runs on in a strain of wild enthusiasm about <i>Shirley</i>, and concludes 
by announcing a fixed, deliberate resolution to institute a search after 
Currer Bell, and sooner or later to find him out.&nbsp; There is power in 
the letter&mdash;talent; it is at times eloquently expressed.&nbsp; The 
writer somewhat boastfully intimates that he is acknowledged the possessor 
of high intellectual attainments, but, if I mistake not, he betrays a 
temper to be shunned, habits to be mistrusted.&nbsp; While laying claim to 
the character of being affectionate, warm-hearted, and adhesive, there is 
but a single member of his own family of whom he speaks with 
kindness.&nbsp; He confesses himself indolent and wilful, but asserts that 
he is studious and, to some influences, docile.&nbsp; This letter would 
have struck me no more than the others rather like it have done, but for 
its rash power, and the disagreeable resolve it announces to seek and find 
Currer Bell.&nbsp; It almost makes me feel like a wizard who has raised a 
spirit he may find it difficult to lay.&nbsp; But I shall not think about 
it.&nbsp; This sort of fervour often foams itself away in words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Trusting that the serenity of your home is by this time restored 
with your wife&rsquo;s health,&mdash;I am, yours sincerely,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>February</i> 16<i>th</i>, 1850.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Nell</span>,&mdash;Yesterday, just after
dinner, I heard a loud bustling voice in the kitchen demanding to see Mr. 
Bront&euml;.&nbsp; Somebody was shown into the parlour.&nbsp; Shortly 
after, wine was <!-- page 361--><a name="page361"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 361</span>rung for.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is it, 
Martha?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some mak of a tradesman,&rdquo; said 
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not a gentleman, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
The personage stayed about an hour, talking in a loud vulgar key all the 
time.&nbsp; At tea-time I asked papa who it was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; 
said he, &ldquo;no other than the vicar of B---!&rdquo; <a 
name="citation361"></a><a href="#footnote361" 
class="citation">[361]</a>&nbsp; Papa had invited him to take some 
refreshment, but the creature had ordered his dinner at the Black Bull, and
was quite urgent with papa to go down there and join him, offering by way 
of inducement a bottle, or, if papa liked, &ldquo;two or three bottles of 
the best wine Haworth could afford!&rdquo;&nbsp; He said he was come from 
Bradford just to look at the place, and reckoned to be in raptures with the
wild scenery!&nbsp; He warmly pressed papa to come and see him, and to 
bring his daughter with him!!!&nbsp; Does he know anything about the books,
do you think; he made no allusion to them.&nbsp; I did not see him, not so 
much as the tail of his coat.&nbsp; Martha said he looked no more like a 
parson than she did.&nbsp; Papa described him as rather shabby-looking, but
said he was wondrous cordial and friendly.&nbsp; Papa, in his usual 
fashion, put him through a regular catechism of questions: what his living 
was worth, etc., etc.&nbsp; In answer to inquiries respecting his age he 
affirmed himself to be thirty-seven&mdash;is not this a lie?&nbsp; He must 
be more.&nbsp; Papa asked him if he were married.&nbsp; He said no, he had 
no thoughts of being married, he did not like the trouble of a wife.&nbsp; 
He described himself as &ldquo;living in style, and keeping a very 
hospitable house.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>April</i> 3<i>rd</i>, 1850.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have received the
<i>Dublin Review</i>, and your letter inclosing the Indian Notices.&nbsp; I
hope these reviews will do good; they are all favourable, and one of them 
(the <i>Dublin</i>) is very able.&nbsp; I have read no critique so 
discriminating since that in the <i>Revue des deux Mondes</i>.&nbsp; It 
offers a curious contrast to Lewes&rsquo;s in the <i>Edinburgh</i>, where 
forced praise, given by <!-- page 362--><a name="page362"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 362</span>jerks, and obviously without real and cordial 
liking, and censure, crude, conceited, and ignorant, were mixed in random 
lumps&mdash;forming a very loose and inconsistent whole.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you aware whether there are any grounds for that conjecture 
in the <i>Bengal Hurkaru</i>, that the critique in the <i>Times</i> was 
from the pen of Mr. Thackeray?&nbsp; I should much like to know this.&nbsp;
If such were the case (and I feel as if it were by no means impossible), 
the circumstance would open a most curious and novel glimpse of a very 
peculiar disposition.&nbsp; Do you think it likely to be true?</p>
<p>&lsquo;The account you give of Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s health is not 
cheering, but I should think her indisposition is partly owing to the 
variable weather; at least, if you have had the same keen frost and cold 
east winds in London, from which we have lately suffered in 
Yorkshire.&nbsp; I trust the milder temperature we are now enjoying may 
quickly confirm her convalescence.&nbsp; With kind regards to Mrs.

Greenwood&rsquo;s application; and, I am sure, both you and he would feel 
true pleasure could you see the delight and hope with which these liberal 
terms have inspired a good and intelligent though poor man.&nbsp; He thinks
he now sees a prospect of getting his livelihood by a method which will 
suit him better than wool-combing work has hitherto done, exercising more 
of his faculties and sparing his health.&nbsp; He will do his best, I am 
sure, to extend the sale of the cheap edition of <i>Jane Eyre</i>; and 
whatever twinges I may still feel at the thought of that work being in the 
possession of all the worthy folk of Haworth and Keighley, such scruples 
are more than counterbalanced by the attendant good;&mdash;I mean, by the 
assistance it will give a man who deserves assistance.&nbsp; I wish he 
could permanently establish a little bookselling business in Haworth: it 
would benefit the place as well as himself.</p>

tolerable.&nbsp; Will not the public in general be of the same 
opinion?&nbsp; And are you not making yourselves causelessly uneasy on the 
subject?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I imagine few will discover the defects of typography unless they
are pointed out.&nbsp; There are, no doubt, technical faults and 
perfections in the art of printing to which printers and publishers ascribe
a greater importance than the majority of readers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will mention Mr. Smith&rsquo;s proposal respecting the cheap 
publications to Greenwood.&nbsp; I believe him to be a man on whom 
encouragement is not likely to be thrown away, and who, if fortune should 
not prove quite adverse, will contrive to effect something by dint of 
intelligence and perseverance.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I trust your 
suggestion for Miss Kavanagh&rsquo;s benefit will have all success.&nbsp; 
It seems to me truly felicitous and excellent, and, I doubt not, she will 
think so too.&nbsp; The last class of female character will be difficult to
manage: there will be nice points in it&mdash;yet, well-managed, both an 
attractive and instructive book might result therefrom.&nbsp; One thing may
be depended upon in the execution of this plan.&nbsp; Miss Kavanagh will 
commit no error, either of taste, judgment, or principle; and even when she
deals with the feelings, I would rather <!-- page 364--><a 
name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 364</span>follow the calm 
course of her quiet pen than the flourishes of a more redundant one where 
there is not strength to restrain as well as ardour to impel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear I seemed to you to speak coolly of the beauty of the Lake 
scenery.&nbsp; The truth is, it was, as scenery, exquisite&mdash;far beyond
anything I saw in Scotland; but it did not give me half so much pleasure, 
because I saw it under less congenial auspices.&nbsp; Mr. Smith and Sir J. 
K. Shuttleworth are two different people with whom to travel.&nbsp; I need 
say nothing of the former&mdash;you know him.&nbsp; The latter offers me 
his friendship, and I do my best to be grateful for the gift; but his is a 
nature with which it is difficult to assimilate&mdash;and where there is no
assimilation, how can there be real regard?&nbsp; Nine parts out of ten in 
him are utilitarian&mdash;the tenth is artistic.&nbsp; This tithe of his 
nature seems to me at war with all the rest&mdash;it is just enough to 
incline him restlessly towards the artist class, and far too little to make
him one of them.&nbsp; The consequent inability to <i>do</i> things which 
he <i>admires</i>, embitters him I think&mdash;it makes him doubt 
perfections and dwell on faults.&nbsp; Then his notice or presence scarcely
tend to set one at ease or make one happy: he is worldly and formal.&nbsp; 
But I must stop&mdash;have I already said too much?&nbsp; I think not, for 
you will feel it is said in confidence and will not repeat it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The article in the <i>Palladium</i> is indeed such as to atone 
for a hundred unfavourable or imbecile reviews.&nbsp; I have expressed what
I think of it to Mr. Taylor, who kindly wrote me a letter on the 
subject.&nbsp; I thank you also for the newspaper notices, and for some you
sent me a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should much like to carry out your suggestions respecting a 
reprint of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and <i>Agnes Grey</i> in one volume, 
with a prefatory and explanatory notice of the authors; but the question 
occurs, Would Newby claim it?&nbsp; I could not bear to commit it to any 
other hands than those of Mr. Smith.&nbsp; <i>Wildfell Hall</i>, it hardly 
appears to me desirable to preserve.&nbsp; The choice of subject in that 
work is a mistake: it was too little consonant with the character, tastes, 
and ideas of the gentle, retiring, inexperienced writer.&nbsp; She wrote it
under <!-- page 365--><a name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
365</span>a strange, conscientious, half-ascetic notion of accomplishing a 
painful penance and a severe duty.&nbsp; Blameless in deed and almost in 
thought, there was from her very childhood a tinge of religious melancholy 
in her mind.&nbsp; This I ever suspected, and I have found amongst her 
papers mournful proofs that such was the case.&nbsp; As to additional 
compositions, I think there would be none, as I would not offer a line to 
the publication of which my sisters themselves would have objected.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Mr. Newby undertook
first to print 350 copies of <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, but he afterwards 
declared he had only printed 250.&nbsp; I doubt whether he could be induced
to return the &pound;50 without a good deal of trouble&mdash;much more than
I should feel justified in delegating to Mr. Smith.&nbsp; For my own part, 
the conclusion I drew from the whole of Mr. Newby&rsquo;s conduct to my 
sisters was that he is a man with whom it is desirable to have little to 
do.&nbsp; I think he must be needy as well as tricky&mdash;and if he is, 
one would not distress him, even for one&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If Mr. Smith thinks right to reprint <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and
<i>Agnes Grey</i>, I would prepare a preface comprising a brief and simple 
notice of the authors, such as might set at rest all erroneous conjectures 
respecting their identity&mdash;and adding a few poetical remains of 
each.</p>

misunderstood&mdash;not for a moment, I never misunderstand you&mdash;I was
thinking of the critics and the public, who are always crying for a moral

you?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I forgot to say that I had already heard, first from Miss 
Martineau, and subsequently through an intimate friend of Sydney Yendys

much wished to see it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I trouble you to look at a sentence in the Preface which I 
have erased, because on reading it over I was not quite sure about the 
scientific correctness of the expressions used.&nbsp; Metal, I know, will 
burn in vivid-coloured flame, exposed to galvanic action, but whether it is
consumed, I am not sure.&nbsp; Perhaps you or Mr. Taylor can tell me 
whether there is any blunder in the term employed&mdash;if not, it might

now only regret the necessity of disappointing the <i>Palladium</i>, but 
that cannot be helped.&mdash;Good-bye, my dear sir, yours very 
sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C.

<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>Tuesday Morning</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;The rather dark view
you seem inclined to take of the general opinion about <i>Villette</i> 
surprises me the less, dear Nell, as only the more unfavourable reviews 
seem to have come in your way.&nbsp; Some reports reach me of a different 
tendency; but no matter, time will shew.&nbsp; As to the character of Lucy 
Snow, my intention from the first was that she should not occupy the 
pedestal to which Jane Eyre was raised by some injudicious admirers.&nbsp; 
She is where I meant her to be, and where no charge of self-laudation can 
touch her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot accept your kind invitation.&nbsp; I must be at home at 
Easter, on two or three accounts connected with sermons to be preached, 
parsons to be entertained, Mechanics&rsquo; Institute meetings and 
tea-drinkings to be solemnised, and ere long I have promised to go and see 
Mrs. Gaskell; but till this wintry weather is passed, I would rather eschew
visiting anywhere.&nbsp; I trust that bad cold of yours is <i>quite</i> 
well, and that you will take good care of yourself in future.&nbsp; That 
night work is always perilous.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C.

<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS WOOLER</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>April</i> 13<i>th</i>, 1851.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Wooler</span>,&mdash;Your last 
kind letter ought to have been answered long since, and would have been, 
did I find it practicable to proportion the promptitude of the response to 
the value I place upon my correspondents and their communications.&nbsp; 
You will easily understand, however, that <!-- page 368--><a 
name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 368</span>the contrary rule 
often holds good, and that the epistle which importunes often takes 
precedence of that which interests.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My publishers express entire satisfaction with the reception 
which has been accorded to <i>Villette</i>, and indeed the majority of the 
reviews has been favourable enough; you will be aware, however, that there 
is a minority, small in number but influential in character, which views 
the work with no favourable eye.&nbsp; Currer Bell&rsquo;s remarks on 
Romanism have drawn down on him the condign displeasure of the High Church 
party, which displeasure has been unequivocally expressed through their 
principal organs&mdash;the <i>Guardian</i>, the <i>English Churchman</i>, 
and the <i>Christian Remembrancer</i>.&nbsp; I can well understand that 
some of the charges launched against me by those publications will tell 
heavily to my prejudice in the minds of most readers&mdash;but this must be
borne; and for my part, I can suffer no accusation to oppress me much which
is not supported by the inward evidence of conscience and reason.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Extremes meet,&rdquo; says the proverb; in proof whereof I
would mention that Miss Martineau finds with <i>Villette</i> nearly the 
same fault as the Puseyites.&nbsp; She accuses me with attacking popery 
&ldquo;with virulence,&rdquo; of going out of my way to assault it 
&ldquo;passionately.&rdquo;&nbsp; In other respects she has shown with 
reference to the work a spirit so strangely and unexpectedly acrimonious, 
that I have gathered courage to tell her that the gulf of mutual difference
between her and me is so wide and deep, the bridge of union so slight and 
uncertain, I have come to the conclusion that frequent intercourse would be
most perilous and unadvisable, and have begged to adjourn <i>sine die</i> 
my long projected visit to her.&nbsp; Of course she is now very angry, and 
I know her bitterness will not be short-lived&mdash;but it cannot be 
helped.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two or three weeks since I received a long and kind letter from 
Mr. White, which I answered a short time ago.&nbsp; I believe Mr. White 
thinks me a much hotter advocate for <i>change</i> and what is called 
&ldquo;political progress&rdquo; than I am.&nbsp; However, in my reply, I 
did not touch on these subjects.&nbsp; He intimated a wish to publish some 
of his own MSS.&nbsp; I fear he would hardly <!-- page 369--><a 
name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 369</span>like the somewhat 
dissuasive tendency of my answer; but really, in these days of headlong 
competition, it is a great risk to publish.&nbsp; If all be well, I purpose
going to Manchester next week to spend a few days with Mrs. Gaskell.&nbsp; 
Ellen&rsquo;s visit to Yarmouth seems for the present given up; and really,
all things considered, I think the circumstance is scarcely to be 
regretted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you not think, my dear Miss Wooler, that you could come to 
Haworth before you go to the coast?&nbsp; I am afraid that when you once 
get settled at the sea-side your stay will not be brief.&nbsp; I must 
repeat that a visit from you would be anticipated with pleasure, not only 
by me, but by every inmate of Haworth Parsonage.&nbsp; Papa has given me a 
general commission to send his respects to you whenever I 
write&mdash;accept them, therefore, and&mdash;Believe me, yours 
affectionately and sincerely,</p>

370</span>CHAPTER XIV: WILLIAM SMITH WILLIAMS</h2>
<p>In picturing the circle which surrounded Charlotte Bront&euml; through 
her brief career, it is of the utmost importance that a word of recognition
should be given, and that in no half-hearted manner, to Mr. William Smith 
Williams, who, in her later years, was Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s most 
intimate correspondent.&nbsp; The letters to Mr. Williams are far and away 
the best that Charlotte wrote, at least of those which have been 
preserved.&nbsp; They are full of literary enthusiasm and of intellectual 
interest.&nbsp; They show Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s sound judgment and 
good heart more effectually than any other material which has been placed 
at the disposal of biographers.&nbsp; They are an honour both to writer and
receiver, and, in fact, reflect the mind of the one as much as the mind of 
the other.&nbsp; Charlotte has emphasised the fact that she adapted herself
to her correspondents, and in her letters to Mr. Williams we have her at 
her very best.&nbsp; Mr. Williams occupied for many years the post of 
&lsquo;reader&rsquo; in the firm of Smith &amp; Elder.&nbsp; That is a 
position scarcely less honourable and important than authorship 
itself.&nbsp; In our own days Mr. George Meredith and Mr. John Morley have 
been &lsquo;readers,&rsquo; and Mr. James Payn has held the same post in 
the firm which published the Bront&euml; novels.</p>
<p>Mr. Williams, who was born in 1800, and died in 1875, had an interesting
career even before he became associated with Smith &amp; Elder.&nbsp; In 
his younger days he was <!-- page 371--><a name="page371"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 371</span>apprenticed to Taylor &amp; Hessey of Fleet 
Street; and he used to relate how his boyish ideals of Coleridge were 
shattered on beholding, for the first time, the bulky and ponderous figure 
of the great talker.&nbsp; When Keats left England, for an early grave in 
Rome, it was Mr. Williams who saw him off.&nbsp; Hazlitt, Leigh Hunt, and 
many other well-known men of letters were friendly with Mr. Williams from 
his earliest days, and he had for brother-in-law, Wells, the author of 
<i>Joseph and his Brethren</i>.&nbsp; In his association with Smith &amp; 
Elder he secured the friendship of Thackeray, of Mrs. Gaskell, and of many 
other writers.&nbsp; He attracted the notice of Ruskin by a keen enthusiasm
for the work of Turner.&nbsp; It was he, in fact, who compiled that most 
interesting volume of <i>Selections from the writings of John Ruskin</i>, 
which has long gone out of print in its first form, but is still greatly 
sought for by the curious.&nbsp; In connection with this volume I may print
here a letter written by John Ruskin&rsquo;s father to Mr. Williams, and I 
do so the more readily, as Mr. Williams&rsquo;s name was withheld from the 
title-page of the <i>Selections</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Denmark Hill</span>, 
25<i>th November</i>, 1861.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am requested by 
Mrs. Ruskin to return her very sincere and grateful thanks for your kind 
consideration in presenting her with so beautifully bound a copy of the 
<i>Selections</i> from her son&rsquo;s writings; and which she will have 
great pleasure in seeing by the side of the very magnificent volumes which 
the liberality of the gentlemen of your house has already enriched our 
library with.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Ruskin joins me in offering congratulations on the great 
judgment you have displayed in your <i>Selections</i>, and, sending my own 
thanks and those of my son for the handsome gift to Mrs. Ruskin,&mdash;I 
am, my dear sir, yours very truly,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">John James 
Ruskin</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 372--><a name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
372</span>What Charlotte Bront&euml; thought of Mr. Williams is 
sufficiently revealed by the multitude of letters which I have the good 
fortune to print, and that she had a reason to be grateful to him is 
obvious when we recollect that to him, and to him alone, was due her first 
recognition.&nbsp; The parcel containing <i>The Professor</i> had wandered 
from publisher to publisher before it came into the hands of Mr. 
Williams.&nbsp; It was he who recognised what all of us recognise now, that
in spite of faults it is really a most considerable book.&nbsp; I am 
inclined to think that it was refused by Smith &amp; Elder rather on 
account of its insufficient length than for any other cause.&nbsp; At any 
rate it was the length which was assigned to her as a reason for 
non-acceptance.&nbsp; She was told that another book, which would make the 
accredited three volume novel, might receive more favourable 
consideration.</p>
<p>Charlotte Bront&euml; took Mr. Williams&rsquo;s advice.&nbsp; She wrote 
<i>Jane Eyre</i>, and despatched it quickly to Smith &amp; Elder&rsquo;s 
house in Cornhill.&nbsp; It was read by Mr. Williams, and read afterwards 
by Mr. George Smith; and it was published with the success that we 
know.&nbsp; Charlotte awoke to find herself famous.&nbsp; She became a 
regular correspondent with Mr. Williams, and not less than a hundred 
letters were sent to him, most of them treating of interesting literary 
matters.</p>
<p>One of Mr. Williams&rsquo;s daughters, I may add, married Mr. Lowes 
Dickenson the portrait painter; his youngest child, a baby when Miss 
Bront&euml; was alive, is famous in the musical world as Miss Anna 
Williams.&nbsp; The family has an abundance of literary and artistic 
association, but the father we know as the friend and correspondent of 
Charlotte Bront&euml;.&nbsp; He still lives also in the memory of a large 
circle as a kindly and attractive&mdash;a singularly good and upright 
man.</p>
<p>Comment upon the following letters is in well-nigh every case 
superfluous.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 373--><a name="page373"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 373</span>TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>February</i> 25<i>th</i> 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I thank you for 
your note; its contents moved me much, though not to unmingled feelings of 
exultation.&nbsp; Louis Philippe (unhappy and sordid old man!) and M. 
Guizot doubtless merit the sharp lesson they are now being taught, because 
they have both proved themselves men of dishonest hearts.&nbsp; And every 
struggle any nation makes in the cause of Freedom and Truth has something 
noble in it&mdash;something that makes me wish it success; but I cannot 
believe that France&mdash;or at least Paris&mdash;will ever be the 
battle-ground of true Liberty, or the scene of its real triumphs.&nbsp; I 
fear she does not know &ldquo;how genuine glory is put on.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is 
that strength to be found in her which will not bend &ldquo;but in 
magnanimous meekness&rdquo;?&nbsp; Have not her &ldquo;unceasing 
changes&rdquo; as yet always brought &ldquo;perpetual 
emptiness&rdquo;?&nbsp; Has Paris the materials within her for thorough 
reform?&nbsp; Mean, dishonest Guizot being discarded, will any better 
successor be found for him than brilliant, unprincipled Thiers?</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I damp your enthusiasm, which I would not wish to do, for 
true enthusiasm is a fine feeling whose flash I admire wherever I see 
it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The little note inclosed in yours is from a French lady, who asks
my consent to the translation of <i>Jane Eyre</i> into the French 
language.&nbsp; I thought it better to consult you before I replied.&nbsp; 
I suppose she is competent to produce a decent translation, though one or 
two errors of orthography in her note rather afflict the eye; but I know 
that it is not unusual for what are considered well-educated French women 
to fail in the point of writing their mother tongue correctly.&nbsp; But 
whether competent or not, I presume she has a right to translate the book 
with or without my consent.&nbsp; She gives her address: Mdlle B--- <a 
name="citation373"></a><a href="#footnote373" 
class="citation">[373]</a>&nbsp; W. Cumming, Esq., 23 North Bank, 
Regent&rsquo;s Park.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I reply to her note in the affirmative?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Waiting your opinion and answer,&mdash;I remain, dear sir, yours 
faithfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. 
Bell</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 374--><a name="page374"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 374</span>TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>February</i> 28<i>th</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have done as you 
advised me respecting Mdlle B---, thanked her for her courtesy, and 
explained that I do not wish my consent to be regarded in the light of a 
formal sanction of the translation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;From the papers of Saturday I had learnt the abdication of Louis 
Philippe, the flight of the royal family, and the proclamation of a 
republic in France.&nbsp; Rapid movements these, and some of them difficult
of comprehension to a remote spectator.&nbsp; What sort of spell has 
withered Louis Philippe&rsquo;s strength?&nbsp; Why, after having so long 
infatuatedly clung to Guizot, did he at once ignobly relinquish him?&nbsp; 
Was it panic that made him so suddenly quit his throne and abandon his 
adherents without a struggle to retain one or aid the other?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps it might have been partly fear, but I daresay it was 
still more long-gathering weariness of the dangers and toils of 
royalty.&nbsp; Few will pity the old monarch in his flight, yet I own he 
seems to me an object of pity.&nbsp; His sister&rsquo;s death shook him; 
years are heavy on him; the sword of Damocles has long been hanging over 
his head.&nbsp; One cannot forget that monarchs and ministers are only 
human, and have only human energies to sustain them; and often they are 
sore beset.&nbsp; Party spirit has no mercy; indignant Freedom seldom shows
forbearance in her hour of revolt.&nbsp; I wish you <i>could</i> see the 
aged gentleman trudging down Cornhill with his umbrella and carpet-bag, in 
good earnest; he would be safe in England: John Bull might laugh at him but
he would do him no harm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How strange it appears to see literary and scientific names 
figuring in the list of members of a Provisional Government!&nbsp; How 
would it sound if Carlyle and Sir John Herschel and Tennyson and Mr. 
Thackeray and Douglas Jerrold were selected to manufacture a new 
constitution for England?&nbsp; Whether do such men sway the public mind 
most effectually from their quiet studies or from a council-chamber?</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Thiers is set aside for a time; but won&rsquo;t they be glad 
of <!-- page 375--><a name="page375"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
375</span>him by-and-by?&nbsp; Can they set aside entirely anything so 
clever, so subtle, so accomplished, so aspiring&mdash;in a word, so 
thoroughly French, as he is?&nbsp; Is he not the man to bide his 
time&mdash;to watch while unskilful theorists try their hand at 
administration and fail; and then to step out and show them how it should 
be done?</p>
<p>&lsquo;One would have thought political disturbance the natural element 
of a mind like Thiers&rsquo;; but I know nothing of him except from his 
writings, and I always think he writes as if the shade of Bonaparte were 
walking to and fro in the room behind him and dictating every line he pens,
sometimes approaching and bending over his shoulder, <i>pour voir de ses 
yeux</i> that such an action or event is represented or misrepresented (as 
the case may be) exactly as he wishes it.&nbsp; Thiers seems to have 
contemplated Napoleon&rsquo;s character till he has imbibed some of its 
nature.&nbsp; Surely he must be an ambitious man, and, if so, surely he 
will at this juncture struggle to rise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You should not apologise for what you call your 
&ldquo;crudities.&rdquo;&nbsp; You know I like to hear your opinions and 
views on whatever subject it interests you to discuss.</p>
<p>&lsquo;From the little inscription outside your note I conclude you sent
me the <i>Examiner</i>.&nbsp; I thank you therefore for your kind intention
and am sorry some unscrupulous person at the Post Office frustrated it, as 
no paper has reached my hands.&nbsp; I suppose one ought to be thankful 
that letters are respected, as newspapers are by no means sure of safe 
conveyance.&mdash;I remain, dear sir, yours sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. 
Bell</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>May</i> 12<i>th</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I take a large 
sheet of paper, because I foresee that I am about to write another long 
letter, and for the same reason as before, viz., that yours interested 
me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have received the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>, and was both 
surprised and pleased to see the passage you speak of in one of its leading
articles.&nbsp; An allusion of that sort seems to say more than a regular 
notice.&nbsp; I <i>do</i> trust I may have the power so to <!-- page 
376--><a name="page376"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 376</span>write in 
future as not to disappoint those who have been kind enough to think and 
speak well of <i>Jane Eyre</i>; at any rate, I will take pains.&nbsp; But 
still, whenever I hear my one book praised, the pleasure I feel is 
chastened by a mixture of doubt and fear; and, in truth, I hardly wish it 
to be otherwise: it is much too early for me to feel safe, or to take as my
due the commendation bestowed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some remarks in your last letter on teaching commanded my 
attention.&nbsp; I suppose you never were engaged in tuition yourself; but 
if you had been, you could not have more exactly hit on the great 
qualification&mdash;I had almost said the <i>one</i> great 
qualification&mdash;necessary to the task: the faculty, not merely of 
acquiring but of imparting knowledge&mdash;the power of influencing young 
minds&mdash;that natural fondness for, that innate sympathy with, children,
which, you say, Mrs. Williams is so happy as to possess.&nbsp; He or she 
who possesses this faculty, this sympathy&mdash;though perhaps not 
otherwise highly accomplished&mdash;need never fear failure in the career 
of instruction.&nbsp; Children will be docile with them, will improve under
them; parents will consequently repose in them confidence.&nbsp; Their task
will be comparatively light, their path comparatively smooth.&nbsp; If the 
faculty be absent, the life of a teacher will be a struggle from beginning 
to end.&nbsp; No matter how amiable the disposition, how strong the sense 
of duty, how active the desire to please; no matter how brilliant and 
varied the accomplishments; if the governess has not the power to win her 
young charge, the secret to instil gently and surely her own knowledge into
the growing mind intrusted to her, she will have a wearing, wasting 
existence of it.&nbsp; To <i>educate</i> a child, as I daresay Mrs. 
Williams has educated her children, probably with as much pleasure to 
herself as profit to them, will indeed be impossible to the teacher who 
lacks this qualification.&nbsp; But, I conceive, should 
circumstances&mdash;as in the case of your daughters&mdash;compel a young 
girl notwithstanding to adopt a governess&rsquo;s profession, she may 
contrive to <i>instruct</i> and even to instruct well.&nbsp; That is, 
though she cannot form the child&rsquo;s mind, mould its character, 
influence its disposition, and guide its conduct as she would wish, she may
give <!-- page 377--><a name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
377</span>lessons&mdash;even good, clear, clever lessons in the various 
branches of knowledge.&nbsp; She may earn and doubly earn her scanty salary
as a daily governess.&nbsp; As a school-teacher she may succeed; but as a 
resident governess she will never (except under peculiar and exceptional 
circumstances) be happy.&nbsp; Her deficiency will harass her not so much 
in school-time as in play-hours; the moments that would be rest and 
recreation to the governess who understood and could adapt herself to 
children, will be almost torture to her who has not that power.&nbsp; Many 
a time, when her charge turns unruly on her hands, when the responsibility 
which she would wish to discharge faithfully and perfectly, becomes 
unmanageable to her, she will wish herself a housemaid or kitchen girl, 
rather than a baited, trampled, desolate, distracted governess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Governesses&rsquo; Institution may be an excellent thing in 
some points of view, but it is both absurd and cruel to attempt to raise 
still higher the standard of acquirements.&nbsp; Already governesses are 
not half nor a quarter paid for what they teach, nor in most instances is 
half or a quarter of their attainments required by their pupils.&nbsp; The 
young teacher&rsquo;s chief anxiety, when she sets out in life, always is 
to know a great deal; her chief fear that she should not know enough.&nbsp;
Brief experience will, in most instances, show her that this anxiety has 
been misdirected.&nbsp; She will rarely be found too ignorant for her 
pupils; the demand on her knowledge will not often be larger than she can 
answer.&nbsp; But on her patience&mdash;on her self-control, the 
requirement will be enormous; on her animal spirits (and woe be to her if 
these fail!) the pressure will be immense.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have seen an ignorant nursery-maid who could scarcely read or 
write, by dint of an excellent, serviceable, sanguine, phlegmatic 
temperament, which made her at once cheerful and unmoveable; of a robust 
constitution and steady, unimpassionable nerves, which kept her firm under 
shocks and unharassed under annoyances&mdash;manage with comparative ease a
large family of spoilt children, while their governess lived amongst them a
life of inexpressible misery: tyrannised over, finding <!-- page 378--><a 
name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 378</span>her efforts to please
and teach utterly vain, chagrined, distressed, worried&mdash;so badgered, 
so trodden on, that she ceased almost at last to know herself, and wondered
in what despicable, trembling frame her oppressed mind was prisoned, and 
could not realise the idea of ever more being treated with respect and 
regarded with affection&mdash;till she finally resigned her situation and 
went away quite broken in spirit and reduced to the verge of decline in 
health.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those who would urge on governesses more acquirements, do not 
know the origin of their chief sufferings.&nbsp; It is more physical and 
mental strength, denser moral impassibility that they require, rather than 
additional skill in arts or sciences.&nbsp; As to the forcing system, 
whether applied to teachers or taught, I hold it to be a cruel system.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is true the world demands a brilliant list of 
accomplishments.&nbsp; For &pound;20 per annum, it expects in one woman the
attainments of several professors&mdash;but the demand is insensate, and I 
think should rather be resisted than complied with.&nbsp; If I might plead 
with you in behalf of your daughters, I should say, &ldquo;Do not let them 
waste their young lives in trying to attain manifold accomplishments.&nbsp;
Let them try rather to possess thoroughly, fully, one or two talents; then 
let them endeavour to lay in a stock of health, strength, 
cheerfulness.&nbsp; Let them labour to attain self-control, endurance, 
fortitude, firmness; if possible, let them learn from their mother 
something of the precious art she possesses&mdash;these things, together 
with sound principles, will be their best supports, their best aids through
a governess&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As for that one who, you say, has a nervous horror of exhibition,
I need not beg you to be gentle with her; I am sure you will not be harsh, 
but she must be firm with herself, or she will repent it in after 
life.&nbsp; She should begin by degrees to endeavour to overcome her 
diffidence.&nbsp; Were she destined to enjoy an independent, easy 
existence, she might respect her natural disposition to seek retirement, 
and even cherish it as a shade-loving virtue; but since that is not her 
lot, since she is fated to make her way in the crowd, and to depend on 
herself, <!-- page 379--><a name="page379"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
379</span>she should say: I will try and learn the art of self-possession, 
not that I may display my accomplishments, but that I may have the 
satisfaction of feeling that I am my own mistress, and can move and speak 
undaunted by the fear of man.&nbsp; While, however, I pen this piece of 
advice, I confess that it is much easier to give than to follow.&nbsp; What
the sensations of the nervous are under the gaze of publicity none but the 
nervous know; and how powerless reason and resolution are to control them 
would sound incredible except to the actual sufferers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The rumours you mention respecting the authorship of <i>Jane 
Eyre</i> amused me inexpressibly.&nbsp; The gossips are, on this subject, 
just where I should wish them to be, <i>i.e.</i>, as far from the truth as 
possible; and as they have not a grain of fact to found their fictions 
upon, they fabricate pure inventions.&nbsp; Judge Erle must, I think, have 
made up his story expressly for a hoax; the other <i>fib</i> is 
amazing&mdash;so circumstantial! called on the author, forsooth!&nbsp; 
Where did he live, I wonder?&nbsp; In what purlieu of Cockayne?&nbsp; Here 
I must stop, lest if I run on further I should fill another 
sheet.&mdash;Believe me, yours sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Currer 
Bell</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I must, after all, add a morsel of paper, for I
find, on glancing over yours, that I have forgotten to answer a question 
you ask respecting my next work.&nbsp; I have not therein so far treated of
governesses, as I do not wish it to resemble its predecessor.&nbsp; I often
wish to say something about the &ldquo;condition of women&rdquo; question, 
but it is one respecting which so much &ldquo;cant&rdquo; has been talked, 
that one feels a sort of repugnance to approach it.&nbsp; It is true enough
that the present market for female labour is quite overstocked, but where 
or how could another be opened?&nbsp; Many say that the professions now 
filled only by men should be open to women also; but are not their present 
occupants and candidates more than numerous enough to answer every 
demand?&nbsp; Is there any room for female lawyers, female doctors, female 
engravers, for more female artists, more authoresses?&nbsp; One can see 
where the evil lies, but who can point out the remedy?&nbsp; When a woman 
has <!-- page 380--><a name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
380</span>a little family to rear and educate and a household to conduct, 
her hands are full, her vocation is evident; when her destiny isolates her,
I suppose she must do what she can, live as she can, complain as little, 
bear as much, work as well as possible.&nbsp; This is not high theory, but 
I believe it is sound practice, good to put into execution while 
philosophers and legislators ponder over the better ordering of the social 
system.&nbsp; At the same time, I conceive that when patience has done its 
utmost and industry its best, whether in the case of women or operatives, 
and when both are baffled, and pain and want triumph, the sufferer is free,
is entitled, at last to send up to Heaven any piercing cry for relief, if 
by that cry he can hope to obtain succour.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>June</i> 2, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I snatch a moment 
to write a hasty line to you, for it makes me uneasy to think that your 
last kind letter should have remained so long unanswered.&nbsp; A 
succession of little engagements, much more importunate than important, 
have quite engrossed my time lately, to the exclusion of more momentous and
interesting occupations.&nbsp; Interruption is a sad bore, and I believe 
there is hardly a spot on earth, certainly not in England, quite secure 
from its intrusion.&nbsp; The fact is, you cannot live in this world 
entirely for one aim; you must take along with some single serious purpose 
a hundred little minor duties, cares, distractions; in short, you must take
life as it is, and make the best of it.&nbsp; Summer is decidedly a bad 
season for application, especially in the country; for the sunshine seems 
to set all your acquaintances astir, and, once bent on amusement, they will
come to the ends of the earth in search thereof.&nbsp; I was obliged to you
for your suggestion about writing a letter to the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>,
but I did not follow it up.&nbsp; I think I would rather not venture on 
such a step at present.&nbsp; Opinions I would not hesitate to express to 
you&mdash;because you are indulgent&mdash;are not mature or cool enough for
the public; Currer Bell is not Carlyle, and must not imitate him.</p>
<p><!-- page 381--><a name="page381"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
381</span>&lsquo;Whenever you can write to me without encroaching too much 
on your valuable time, remember I shall always be glad to hear from 
you.&nbsp; Your last letter interested me fully as much as its two 
predecessors; what you said about your family pleased me; I think details 
of character always have a charm even when they relate to people we have 
never seen, nor expect to see.&nbsp; With eight children you must have a 
busy life; but, from the manner in which you allude to your two eldest 
daughters, it is evident that they at least are a source of satisfaction to
their parents; I hope this will be the case with the whole number, and then
you will never feel as if you had too many.&nbsp; A dozen children with 
sense and good conduct may be less burdensome than one who lacks these 
qualities.&nbsp; It seems a long time since I heard from you.&nbsp; I shall
be glad to hear from you again.&mdash;Believe me, yours sincerely,</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. Bell</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>June</i> 15<i>th</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Thank you for your 
two last letters.&nbsp; In reading the first I quite realised your May 
holiday; I enjoyed it with you.&nbsp; I saw the pretty south-of-England 
village, so different from our northern congregations of smoke-dark houses 
clustered round their soot-vomiting mills.&nbsp; I saw in your description,
fertile, flowery Essex&mdash;a contrast indeed to the rough and rude, the 
mute and sombre yet well-beloved moors over-spreading this corner of 
Yorkshire.&nbsp; I saw the white schoolhouse, the venerable 
school-master&mdash;I even thought I saw you and your daughters; and in 
your second letter I see you all distinctly, for, in describing your 
children, you unconsciously describe yourself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I may well say that your letters are of value to me, for I seldom
receive one but I find something in it which makes me reflect, and reflect 
on new themes.&nbsp; Your town life is somewhat different from any I have 
known, and your allusions to its advantages, troubles, pleasures, and 
struggles are often full of significance to me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have always been accustomed to think that the necessity of <!--
page 382--><a name="page382"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 382</span>earning
one&rsquo;s subsistence is not in itself an evil, but I feel it may become 
a heavy evil if health fails, if employment lacks, if the demand upon our 
efforts made by the weakness of others dependent upon us becomes greater 
than our strength suffices to answer.&nbsp; In such a case I can imagine 
that the married man may wish himself single again, and that the married 
woman, when she sees her husband over-exerting himself to maintain her and 
her children, may almost wish&mdash;out of the very force of her affection 
for him&mdash;that it had never been her lot to add to the weight of his 
responsibilities.&nbsp; Most desirable then is it that all, both men and 
women, should have the power and the will to work for themselves&mdash;most
advisable that both sons and daughters should early be inured to habits of 
independence and industry.&nbsp; Birds teach their nestlings to fly as soon
as their wings are strong enough, they even oblige them to quit the nest if
they seem too unwilling to trust their pinions of their own accord.&nbsp; 
Do not the swallow and the starling thus give a lesson by which man might 
profit?</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seems to me that your kind heart is pained by the thought of 
what your daughter may suffer if transplanted from a free and indulged home
existence to a life of constraint and labour amongst strangers.&nbsp; 
Suffer she probably will; but take both comfort and courage, my dear sir, 
try to soothe your anxiety by this thought, which is not a fallacious 
one.&nbsp; Hers will not be a barren suffering; she will gain by it 
largely; she will &ldquo;sow in tears to reap in joy.&rdquo;&nbsp; A 
governess&rsquo;s experience is frequently indeed bitter, but its results 
are precious: the mind, feeling, temper are there subjected to a discipline
equally painful and priceless.&nbsp; I have known many who were unhappy as 
governesses, but not one who regretted having undergone the ordeal, and 
scarcely one whose character was not improved&mdash;at once strengthened 
and purified, fortified and softened, made more enduring for her own 
afflictions, more considerate for the afflictions of others, by passing 
through it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Should your daughter, however, go out as governess, she should 
first take a firm resolution not to be too soon daunted by difficulties, 
too soon disgusted by disagreeables; and if she <!-- page 383--><a 
name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 383</span>has a high spirit, 
sensitive feelings, she should tutor the one to submit, the other to 
endure, <i>for the sake of those at home</i>.&nbsp; That is the 
governess&rsquo;s best talisman of patience, it is the best balm for 
wounded susceptibility.&nbsp; When tried hard she must say, &ldquo;I will 
be patient, not out of servility, but because I love my parents, and wish 
through my perseverance, diligence, and success, to repay their anxieties 
and tenderness for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; With this aid the least-deserved insult
may often be swallowed quite calmly, like a bitter pill with a draught of 
fair water.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think you speak excellent sense when you say that girls without
fortune should be brought up and accustomed to support themselves; and that
if they marry poor men, it should be with a prospect of being able to help 
their partners.&nbsp; If all parents thought so, girls would not be reared 
on speculation with a view to their making mercenary marriages; and, 
consequently, women would not be so piteously degraded as they now too 
often are.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fortuneless people may certainly marry, provided they previously 
resolve never to let the consequences of their marriage throw them as 
burdens on the hands of their relatives.&nbsp; But as life is full of 
unforeseen contingencies, and as a woman may be so placed that she cannot 
possibly both &ldquo;guide the house&rdquo; and earn her livelihood (what 
leisure, for instance, could Mrs. Williams have with her eight children?), 
young artists and young governesses should think twice before they unite 
their destinies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You speak sense again when you express a wish that Fanny were 
placed in a position where active duties would engage her attention, where 
her faculties would be exercised and her mind occupied, and where, I will 
add, not doubting that my addition merely completes your half-approved 
idea, the image of the young artist would for the present recede into the 
background and remain for a few years to come in modest perspective, the 
finishing point of a vista stretching a considerable distance into 
futurity.&nbsp; Fanny may feel sure of this: if she intends to be an 
artist&rsquo;s wife she had better try an apprenticeship with Fortune as a 
governess first; she cannot undergo a better <!-- page 384--><a 
name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 384</span>preparation for that 
honourable (honourable if rightly considered) but certainly not luxurious 
destiny.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should say then&mdash;judging as well as I can from the 
materials for forming an opinion your letter affords, and from what I can 
thence conjecture of Fanny&rsquo;s actual and prospective 
position&mdash;that you would do well and wisely to put your daughter 
out.&nbsp; The experiment might do good and could not do harm, because even
if she failed at the first trial (which is not unlikely) she would still be
in some measure benefited by the effort.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I duly received <i>Mirabeau</i> from Mr. Smith.&nbsp; I must 
repeat, it is really <i>too</i> kind.&nbsp; When I have read the book, I 
will tell you what I think of it&mdash;its subject is interesting.&nbsp; 
One thing a little annoyed me&mdash;as I glanced over the pages I fancied I
detected a savour of Carlyle&rsquo;s peculiarities of style.&nbsp; Now 
Carlyle is a great man, but I always wish he would write plain English; and
to imitate his Germanisms is, I think, to imitate his faults.&nbsp; Is the 
author of this work a Manchester man?&nbsp; I must not ask his name, I 
suppose.&mdash;Believe me, my dear sir, yours sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Currer 
Bell</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>June</i> 22<i>nd</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;After reading a 
book which has both interested and informed you, you like to be able, on 
laying it down, to speak of it with unqualified approbation&mdash;to praise
it cordially; you do not like to stint your panegyric, to counteract its 
effect with blame.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For this reason I feel a little difficulty in telling you what I 
think of <i>The Life of Mirabeau</i>.&nbsp; It has interested me much, and 
I have derived from it additional information.&nbsp; In the course of 
reading it, I have often felt called upon to approve the ability and tact 
of the writer, to admire the skill with which he conducts the narrative, 
enchains the reader&rsquo;s attention, and keeps it fixed upon his hero; 
but I have also been moved frequently to disapprobation.&nbsp; It is not 
the political principles of the writer with which I find fault, nor is it 
his talents I feel <!-- page 385--><a name="page385"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 385</span>inclined to disparage; to speak truth, it is 
his manner of treating Mirabeau&rsquo;s errors that offends&mdash;then, I 
think, he is neither wise nor right&mdash;there, I think, he betrays a 
little of crudeness, a little of presumption, not a little of 
indiscretion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Could you with confidence put this work into the hands of your 
son, secure that its perusal would not harm him, that it would not leave on
his mind some vague impression that there is a grandeur in vice committed 
on a colossal scale?&nbsp; Whereas, the fact is, that in vice there is no 
grandeur, that it is, on whichever side you view it, and in whatever 
accumulation, only a foul, sordid, and degrading thing.&nbsp; The fact is, 
that this great Mirabeau was a mixture of divinity and dirt; that there was
no divinity whatever in his errors, they were all sullying dirt; that they 
ruined him, brought down his genius to the kennel, deadened his fine nature
and generous sentiments, made all his greatness as nothing; that they cut 
him off in his prime, obviated all his aims, and struck him dead in the 
hour when France most needed him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mirabeau&rsquo;s life and fate teach, to my perception, the most 
depressing lesson I have read for years.&nbsp; One would fain have hoped 
that so many noble qualities must have made a noble character and achieved 
noble ends.&nbsp; No&mdash;the mighty genius lived a miserable and degraded
life, and died a dog&rsquo;s death, for want of self-control, for want of 
morality, for lack of religion.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s heart is wrung for 
Mirabeau after reading his life; and it is not of his greatness we think, 
when we close the volume, so much as of his hopeless recklessness, and of 
the sufferings, degradation, and untimely end in which it issued.&nbsp; It 
appears to me that the biographer errs also in being too solicitous to 
present his hero always in a striking point of view&mdash;too negligent of 
the exact truth.&nbsp; He eulogises him too much; he subdues all the other 
characters mentioned and keeps them in the shade that Mirabeau may stand 
out more conspicuously.&nbsp; This, no doubt, is right in art, and 
admissible in fiction; but in history (and biography is the history of an 
individual) it tends to weaken the force of a narrative by weakening your 
faith in its accuracy.</p>

<i>July</i> 13<i>th</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;We reached home 
safely yesterday, and in a day or two I doubt not we shall get the better 
of the fatigues of our journey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was a somewhat hasty step to hurry up to town as we did, but I
do not regret having taken it.&nbsp; In the first place, mystery is 
irksome, and I was glad to shake it off with you and Mr. Smith, and to show
myself to you for what I am, neither more nor less&mdash;thus removing any 
false expectations that may have arisen under the idea that Currer Bell had
a just claim to the masculine cognomen he, perhaps somewhat presumptuously,
adopted&mdash;that he was, in short, of the nobler sex.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was glad also to see you and Mr. Smith, and am very happy now 
to have such pleasant recollections of you both, and of your respective 
families.&nbsp; My satisfaction would have been complete could I have seen 
Mrs. Williams.&nbsp; The appearance of your children tallied on the whole 
accurately with the description you had given of them.&nbsp; Fanny was the 
one I saw least distinctly; I tried to get a clear view of her countenance,
but her position in the room did not favour my efforts.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had just read your article in the <i>John Bull</i>; it very 
clearly and fully explains the cause of the difference obvious between 
ancient and modern paintings.&nbsp; I wish you had been with us <!-- page 
387--><a name="page387"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 387</span>when we went
over the Exhibition and the National Gallery; a little explanation from a 
judge of art would doubtless have enabled us to understand better what we 
saw; perhaps, one day, we may have this pleasure.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Accept my own thanks and my sister&rsquo;s for your kind 
attention to us while in town, and&mdash;Believe me, yours sincerely,</p>

<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>July</i> 31<i>st</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have lately been 
reading <i>Modern Painters</i>, and I have derived from the work much 
genuine pleasure and, I hope, some edification; at any rate, it made me 
feel how ignorant I had previously been on the subject which it 
treats.&nbsp; Hitherto I have only had instinct to guide me in judging of 
art; I feel more as if I had been walking blindfold&mdash;this book seems 
to give me eyes.&nbsp; I <i>do</i> wish I had pictures within reach by 
which to test the new sense.&nbsp; Who can read these glowing descriptions 
of Turner&rsquo;s works without longing to see them?&nbsp; However eloquent
and convincing the language in which another&rsquo;s opinion is placed 
before you, you still wish to judge for yourself.&nbsp; I like this 
author&rsquo;s style much: there is both energy and beauty in it; I like 
himself too, because he is such a hearty admirer.&nbsp; He does not give 
Turner half-measure of praise or veneration, he eulogises, he reverences 
him (or rather his genius) with his whole soul.&nbsp; One can sympathise 
with that sort of devout, serious admiration (for he is no 
rhapsodist)&mdash;one can respect it; and yet possibly many people would 
laugh at it.&nbsp; I am truly obliged to Mr. Smith for giving me this book,
not having often met with one that has pleased me more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will have seen some of the notices of <i>Wildfell 
Hall</i>.&nbsp; I wish my sister felt the unfavourable ones less 
keenly.&nbsp; She does not <i>say</i> much, for she is of a remarkably 
taciturn, still, thoughtful nature, reserved even with her nearest of kin, 
but I cannot avoid seeing that her spirits are depressed sometimes.&nbsp; 
The fact <!-- page 388--><a name="page388"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
388</span>is, neither she nor any of us expected that view to be taken of 
the book which has been taken by some critics.&nbsp; That it had faults of 
execution, faults of art, was obvious, but faults of intention or feeling 
could be suspected by none who knew the writer.&nbsp; For my own part, I 
consider the subject unfortunately chosen&mdash;it was one the author was 
not qualified to handle at once vigorously and truthfully.&nbsp; The simple
and natural&mdash;quiet description and simple pathos are, I think, Acton 
Bell&rsquo;s forte.&nbsp; I liked <i>Agnes Grey</i> better than the present
work.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Permit me to caution you not to speak of my sisters when you 
write to me.&nbsp; I mean, do not use the word in the plural.&nbsp; Ellis 
Bell will not endure to be alluded to under any other appellation than the 
<i>nom de plume</i>.&nbsp; I committed a grand error in betraying his 
identity to you and Mr. Smith.&nbsp; It was inadvertent&mdash;the words, 
&ldquo;we are three sisters&rdquo; escaped me before I was aware.&nbsp; I 
regretted the avowal the moment I had made it; I regret it bitterly now, 
for I find it is against every feeling and intention of Ellis Bell.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was greatly amused to see in the <i>Examiner</i> of this week 
one of Newby&rsquo;s little cobwebs neatly swept away by some dexterous 
brush.&nbsp; If Newby is not too old to profit by experience, such an 
exposure ought to teach him that &ldquo;Honesty is indeed the best 
policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your letter has just been brought to me.&nbsp; I must not pause 
to thank you, I should say too much.&nbsp; Our life is, and always has 
been, one of few pleasures, as you seem in part to guess, and for that 
reason we feel what passages of enjoyment come in our way very keenly; and 
I think if you knew <i>how</i> pleased I am to get a long letter from you, 
you would laugh at me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In return, however, I smile at you for the earnestness with which
you urge on us the propriety of seeing something of London society.&nbsp; 
There would be an advantage in it&mdash;a great advantage; yet it is one 
that no power on earth could induce Ellis Bell, for instance, to avail 
himself of.&nbsp; And even for Acton and Currer, the experiment of an 
introduction to society would be more formidable than you, probably, can 
well imagine.&nbsp; An existence of absolute seclusion and unvarying 
monotony, such <!-- page 389--><a name="page389"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 389</span>as we have long&mdash;I may say, indeed, 
ever&mdash;been habituated to, tends, I fear, to unfit the mind for lively 
and exciting scenes, to destroy the capacity for social enjoyment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The only glimpses of society I have ever had were obtained in my 
vocation of governess, and some of the most miserable moments I can recall 
were passed in drawing-rooms full of strange faces.&nbsp; At such times, my
animal spirits would ebb gradually till they sank quite away, and when I 
could endure the sense of exhaustion and solitude no longer, I used to 
steal off, too glad to find any corner where I could really be alone.&nbsp;
Still, I know very well, that though that experiment of seeing the world 
might give acute pain for the time, it would do good afterwards; and as I 
have never, that I remember, gained any important good without incurring 
proportionate suffering, I mean to try to take your advice some day, in 
part at least&mdash;to put off, if possible, that troublesome egotism which
is always judging and blaming itself, and to try, country spinster as I am,
to get a view of some sphere where civilised humanity is to be 
contemplated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I smile at you again for supposing that I could be annoyed by 
what you say respecting your religious and philosophical views; that I 
could blame you for not being able, when you look amongst sects and creeds,
to discover any one which you can exclusively and implicitly adopt as 
yours.&nbsp; I perceive myself that some light falls on earth from 
Heaven&mdash;that some rays from the shrine of truth pierce the darkness of
this life and world; but they are few, faint, and scattered, and who 
without presumption can assert that he has found the <i>only</i> true path 
upwards?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet ignorance, weakness, or indiscretion, must have their creeds 
and forms; they must have their props&mdash;they cannot walk alone.&nbsp; 
Let them hold by what is purest in doctrine and simplest in ritual; 
<i>something</i>, they <i>must</i> have.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never read Emerson; but the book which has had so healing an 
effect on your mind must be a good one.&nbsp; Very enviable is the writer 
whose words have fallen like a gentle rain on a soil that so needed and 
merited refreshment, whose <!-- page 390--><a name="page390"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 390</span>influence has come like a genial breeze to 
lift a spirit which circumstances seem so harshly to have trampled.&nbsp; 
Emerson, if he has cheered you, has not written in vain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;May this feeling of self-reconcilement, of inward peace and 
strength, continue!&nbsp; May you still be lenient with, be just to, 
yourself!&nbsp; I will not praise nor flatter you, I should hate to pay 
those enervating compliments which tend to check the exertions of a mind 
that aspires after excellence; but I must permit myself to remark that if 
you had not something good and superior in you, something better, whether 
more <i>showy</i> or not, than is often met with, the assurance of your 
friendship would not make one so happy as it does; nor would the advantage 
of your correspondence be felt as such a privilege.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s state of health may soon improve and
her anxieties lessen.&nbsp; Blameable indeed are those who sow division 
where there ought to be peace, and especially deserving of the ban of 
society.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thank both you and your family for keeping our secret.&nbsp; It
will indeed be a kindness to us to persevere in doing so; and I own I have 
a certain confidence in the honourable discretion of a household of which 
you are the head.&mdash;Believe me, yours very sincerely,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Not feeling 
competent this evening either for study or serious composition, I will 
console myself with writing to you.&nbsp; My malady, which the doctors call
a bilious fever, lingers, or rather it returns with each sudden change of 
weather, though I am thankful to say that the relapses have hitherto been 
much milder than the first attack; but they keep me weak and reduced, 
especially as I am obliged to observe a very low spare diet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My book, alas! is laid aside for the present; both head and hand 
seem to have lost their cunning; imagination is pale, stagnant, mute.&nbsp;
This incapacity chagrins me; sometimes I have a feeling of cankering care 
on the subject, but I combat it as well as I can; it does no good.</p>
<p><!-- page 391--><a name="page391"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
391</span>&lsquo;I am afraid I shall not write a cheerful letter to 
you.&nbsp; A letter, however, of some kind I am determined to write, for I 
should be sorry to appear a neglectful correspondent to one from whose 
communications I have derived, and still derive, so much pleasure.&nbsp; Do
not talk about not being on a level with Currer Bell, or regard him as 
&ldquo;an awful person&rdquo;; if you saw him now, sitting muffled at the 
fireside, shrinking before the east wind (which for some days has been 
blowing wild and keen over our cold hills), and incapable of lifting a pen 
for any less formidable task than that of writing a few lines to an 
indulgent friend, you would be sorry not to deem yourself greatly his 
superior, for you would feel him to be a poor creature.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may be sure I read your views on the providence of God and 
the nature of man with interest.&nbsp; You are already aware that in much 
of what you say my opinions coincide with those you express, and where they
differ I shall not attempt to bias you.&nbsp; Thought and conscience are, 
or ought to be, free; and, at any rate, if your views were universally 
adopted there would be no persecution, no bigotry.&nbsp; But never try to 
proselytise, the world is not yet fit to receive what you and Emerson say: 
man, as he now is, can no more do without creeds and forms in religion than
he can do without laws and rules in social intercourse.&nbsp; You and 
Emerson judge others by yourselves; all mankind are not like you, any more 
than every Israelite was like Nathaniel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Is there a human being,&rdquo; you ask, &ldquo;so depraved
that an act of kindness will not touch&mdash;nay, a word melt 
him?&rdquo;&nbsp; There are hundreds of human beings who trample on acts of
kindness and mock at words of affection.&nbsp; I know this though I have 
seen but little of the world.&nbsp; I suppose I have something harsher in 
my nature than you have, something which every now and then tells me dreary
secrets about my race, and I cannot believe the voice of the Optimist, 
charm he never so wisely.&nbsp; On the other hand, I feel forced to listen 
when a Thackeray speaks.&nbsp; I know truth is delivering her oracles by 
his lips.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to the great, good, magnanimous acts which have been <!-- page
392--><a name="page392"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 392</span>performed by
some men, we trace them up to motives and then estimate their value; a few,
perhaps, would gain and many lose by this test.&nbsp; The study of motives 
is a strange one, not to be pursued too far by one fallible human being in 
reference to his fellows.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not condemn me as uncharitable.&nbsp; I have no wish to urge 
my convictions on you, but I know that while there are many good, sincere, 
gentle people in the world, with whom kindness is all-powerful, there are 
also not a few like that false friend (I had almost written <i>fiend</i>) 
whom you so well and vividly described in one of your late letters, and 
who, in acting out his part of domestic traitor, must often have turned 
benefits into weapons wherewith to wound his benefactors.&mdash;Believe me,

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>April</i> 2<i>nd</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;My critics truly 
deserve and have my genuine thanks for the friendly candour with which they
have declared their opinions on my book.&nbsp; Both Mr. Williams and Mr. 
Taylor express and support their opinions in a manner calculated to command
careful consideration.&nbsp; In my turn I have a word to say.&nbsp; You 
both of you dwell too much on what you regard as the <i>artistic</i> 
treatment of a subject.&nbsp; Say what you will, gentlemen&mdash;say it as 
ably as you will&mdash;truth is better than art.&nbsp; Burns&rsquo; Songs 
are better than Bulwer&rsquo;s Epics.&nbsp; Thackeray&rsquo;s rude, 
careless sketches are preferable to thousands of carefully finished 
paintings.&nbsp; Ignorant as I am, I dare to hold and maintain that 
doctrine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must not expect me to give up Malone and Donne too 
suddenly&mdash;the pair are favourites with me; they shine with a chastened
and pleasing lustre in that first chapter, and it is a pity you do not take
pleasure in their modest twinkle.&nbsp; Neither is that opening scene 
irrelevant to the rest of the book, there are other touches in store which 
will harmonise with it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No doubt this handling of the surplice will stir up such <!-- 
page 393--><a name="page393"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
393</span>publications as the <i>Christian Remembrancer</i> and the 
<i>Quarterly</i>&mdash;those heavy Goliaths of the periodical press; and if
I alone were concerned, this possibility would not trouble me a 
second.&nbsp; Full welcome would the giants be to stand in their greaves of
brass, poising their ponderous spears, cursing their prey by their gods, 
and thundering invitations to the intended victim to &ldquo;come 
forth&rdquo; and have his flesh given to the fowls of the air and the 
beasts of the field.&nbsp; Currer Bell, without pretending to be a David, 
feels no awe of the unwieldy Anakim; but&mdash;comprehend me rightly, 
gentlemen&mdash;it would grieve him to involve others in blame: any censure
that would really injure and annoy his publishers would wound 
himself.&nbsp; Therefore believe that he will not act rashly&mdash;trust 
his discretion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Taylor is right about the bad taste of the opening 
apostrophe&mdash;that I had already condemned in my own mind.&nbsp; Enough 
said of a work in embryo.&nbsp; Permit me to request in conclusion that the
MS. may now be returned as soon as convenient.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The letter you inclosed is from Mary Howitt.&nbsp; It contained a
proposal for an engagement as contributor to an American periodical.&nbsp; 
Of course I have negatived it.&nbsp; When I <i>can</i> write, the book I 
have in hand must claim all my attention.&nbsp; Oh! if Anne were well, if 
the void Death has left were a little closed up, if the dreary word 
<i>nevermore</i> would cease sounding in my ears, I think I could yet do 
something.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a long time since you mentioned your own family 
affairs.&nbsp; I trust Mrs. Williams continues well, and that Fanny and 
your other children prosper.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C.

<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>July</i> 3<i>rd</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You do right to 
address me on subjects which compel me, in order to give a coherent answer,
to quit for a moment my habitual train of thought.&nbsp; The mention of 
your healthy-living daughters reminds me of the world where other people 
live&mdash;where I lived once.&nbsp; Theirs are cheerful <!-- page 394--><a
name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 394</span>images as you present
them&mdash;I have no wish to shut them out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;From all you say of Ellen, the eldest, I am inclined to respect 
her much.&nbsp; I like practical sense which works to the good of 
others.&nbsp; I esteem a dutiful daughter who makes her parents happy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fanny&rsquo;s character I would take on second hand from nobody, 
least of all from her kind father, whose estimate of human nature in 
general inclines rather to what <i>ought</i> to be than to what 
<i>is</i>.&nbsp; Of Fanny I would judge for myself, and that not hastily 
nor on first impressions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to hear that Louisa has a chance of a presentation to 
Queen&rsquo;s College.&nbsp; I hope she will succeed.&nbsp; Do not, my dear
sir, be indifferent&mdash;be earnest about it.&nbsp; Come what may 
afterwards, an education secured is an advantage gained&mdash;a priceless 
advantage.&nbsp; Come what may, it is a step towards independency, and one 
great curse of a single female life is its dependency.&nbsp; It does credit
both to Louisa&rsquo;s heart and head that she herself wishes to get this 
presentation.&nbsp; Encourage her in the wish.&nbsp; Your 
daughters&mdash;no more than your sons&mdash;should be a burden on your 
hands.&nbsp; Your daughters&mdash;as much as your sons&mdash;should aim at 
making their way honourably through life.&nbsp; Do not wish to keep them at
home.&nbsp; Believe me, teachers may be hard-worked, ill-paid, and 
despised, but the girl who stays at home doing nothing is worse off than 
the hardest-wrought and worst-paid drudge of a school.&nbsp; Whenever I 
have seen, not merely in humble, but in affluent homes, families of 
daughters sitting waiting to be married, I have pitied them from my 
heart.&nbsp; It is doubtless well&mdash;very well&mdash;if Fate decrees 
them a happy marriage; but, if otherwise, give their existence some object,
their time some occupation, or the peevishness of disappointment and the 
listlessness of idleness will infallibly degrade their nature.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Should Louisa eventually go out as a governess, do not be uneasy 
respecting her lot.&nbsp; The sketch you give of her character leads me to 
think she has a better chance of happiness than one in a hundred of her 
sisterhood.&nbsp; Of pleasing exterior (that is always an 
advantage&mdash;children like it), good <!-- page 395--><a 
name="page395"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 395</span>sense, obliging 
disposition, cheerful, healthy, possessing a good average capacity, but no 
prominent master talent to make her miserable by its cravings for exercise,
by its mutiny under restraint&mdash;Louisa thus endowed will find the post 
of governess comparatively easy.&nbsp; If she be like her mother&mdash;as 
you say she is&mdash;and if, consequently, she is fond of children, and 
possesses tact for managing them, their care is her natural 
vocation&mdash;she ought to be a governess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your sketch of Braxborne, as it is and as it was, is sadly 
pleasing.&nbsp; I remember your first picture of it in a letter written a 
year ago&mdash;only a year ago.&nbsp; I was in this room&mdash;where I now 
am&mdash;when I received it.&nbsp; I was not alone then.&nbsp; In those 
days your letters often served as a text for comment&mdash;a theme for 
talk; now, I read them, return them to their covers and put them 
away.&nbsp; Johnson, I think, makes mournful mention somewhere of the 
pleasure that accrues when we are &ldquo;solitary and cannot impart 
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thoughts, under such circumstances, cannot grow to words, 
impulses fail to ripen to actions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lonely as I am, how should I be if Providence had never given me 
courage to adopt a career&mdash;perseverance to plead through two long, 
weary years with publishers till they admitted me?&nbsp; How should I be 
with youth past, sisters lost, a resident in a moorland parish where there 
is not a single educated family?&nbsp; In that case I should have no world 
at all: the raven, weary of surveying the deluge, and without an ark to 
return to, would be my type.&nbsp; As it is, something like a hope and 
motive sustains me still.&nbsp; I wish all your daughters&mdash;I wish 
every woman in England, had also a hope and motive.&nbsp; Alas! there are 
many old maids who have neither.&mdash;Believe me, yours sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C.

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I must rouse myself
to write a line to you, lest a more protracted silence should seem 
strange.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Truly glad was I to hear of your daughter&rsquo;s success.&nbsp; 
I trust its results may conduce to the permanent advantage both of herself 
and her parents.</p>
<p><!-- page 396--><a name="page396"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
396</span>&lsquo;Of still more importance than your children&rsquo;s 
education is your wife&rsquo;s health, and therefore it is still more 
gratifying to learn that your anxiety on that account is likely to be 
alleviated.&nbsp; For her own sake, no less than for that of others, it is 
to be hoped that she is now secured from a recurrence of her painful and 
dangerous attacks.&nbsp; It was pleasing, too, to hear of good qualities 
being developed in the daughters by the mother&rsquo;s danger.&nbsp; May 
your girls always so act as to justify their father&rsquo;s kind estimate 
of their characters; may they never do what might disappoint or grieve 
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your suggestion relative to myself is a good one in some 
respects, but there are two persons whom it would not suit; and not the 
least incommoded of these would be the young person whom I might request to
come and bury herself in the hills of Haworth, to take a church and stony 
churchyard for her prospect, the dead silence of a village 
parsonage&mdash;in which the tick of the clock is heard all day 
long&mdash;for her atmosphere, and a grave, silent spinster for her 
companion.&nbsp; I should not like to see youth thus immured.&nbsp; The 
hush and gloom of our house would be more oppressive to a buoyant than to a
subdued spirit.&nbsp; The fact is, my work is my best companion; hereafter 
I look for no great earthly comfort except what congenial occupation can 
give.&nbsp; For society, long seclusion has in a great measure unfitted me,
I doubt whether I should enjoy it if I might have it.&nbsp; Sometimes I 
think I should, and I thirst for it; but at other times I doubt my 
capability of pleasing or deriving pleasure.&nbsp; The prisoner in solitary
confinement, the toad in the block of marble, all in time shape themselves 
to their lot.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>September</i> 13<i>th</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I want to know your
opinion of the subject of this proof-sheet.&nbsp; Mr. Taylor censured it; 
he considers as defective all that portion which relates to Shirley&rsquo;s
nervousness&mdash;the bite of the dog, etc.&nbsp; How did it strike you on 
reading it?</p>
<p><!-- page 397--><a name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
397</span>&lsquo;I ask this though I well know it cannot now be 
altered.&nbsp; I can work indefatigably at the correction of a work before 
it leaves my hands, but when once I have looked on it as completed and 
submitted to the inspection of others, it becomes next to impossible to 
alter or amend.&nbsp; With the heavy suspicion on my mind that all may not 
be right, I yet feel forced to put up with the inevitably wrong.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Reading has, of late, been my great solace and recreation.&nbsp; 
I have read J. C. Hare&rsquo;s <i>Guesses at Truth</i>, a book containing 
things that in depth and far-sought wisdom sometimes recall the 
<i>Thoughts</i> of Pascal, only it is as the light of the moon recalls that
of the sun.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have read with pleasure a little book on <i>English Social 
Life</i> by the wife of Archbishop Whately.&nbsp; Good and intelligent 
women write well on such subjects.&nbsp; This lady speaks of 
governesses.&nbsp; I was struck by the contrast offered in her manner of 
treating the topic to that of Miss Rigby in the <i>Quarterly</i>.&nbsp; How
much finer the feeling&mdash;how much truer the feeling&mdash;how much more
delicate the mind here revealed!</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have read <i>David Copperfield</i>; it seems to me very 
good&mdash;admirable in some parts.&nbsp; You said it had affinity to 
<i>Jane Eyre</i>.&nbsp; It has, now and then&mdash;only what an advantage 
has Dickens in his varied knowledge of men and things!&nbsp; I am beginning
to read Eckermann&rsquo;s <i>Goethe</i>&mdash;it promises to be a most 
interesting work.&nbsp; Honest, simple, single-minded Eckermann!&nbsp; 
Great, powerful, giant-souled, but also profoundly egotistical, old Johann 
Wolfgang von Goethe!&nbsp; He <i>was</i> a mighty egotist&mdash;I see he 
was: he thought no more of swallowing up poor Eckermann&rsquo;s existence 
in his own than the whale thought of swallowing Jonah.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The worst of reading graphic accounts of such men, of seeing 
graphic pictures of the scenes, the society, in which they moved, is that 
it excites a too tormenting longing to look on the reality.&nbsp; But does 
such reality now exist?&nbsp; Amidst all the troubled waters of European 
society does such a vast, strong, selfish, old Leviathan now roll 
ponderous!&nbsp; I suppose not.&mdash;Believe me, yours sincerely,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The books came 
yesterday evening just as I was wishing for them very much.&nbsp; There is 
much interest for me in opening the Cornhill parcel.&nbsp; I wish there was
not pain too&mdash;but so it is.&nbsp; As I untie the cords and take out 
the volumes, I am reminded of those who once on similar occasions looked on
eagerly; I miss familiar voices commenting mirthfully and pleasantly; the 
room seems very still, very empty; but yet there is consolation in 
remembering that papa will take pleasure in some of the books.&nbsp; 
Happiness quite unshared can scarcely be called happiness&mdash;it has no 
taste.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope Mrs. Williams continues well, and that she is beginning to
regain composure after the shock of her recent bereavement.&nbsp; She has 
indeed sustained a loss for which there is no substitute.&nbsp; But rich as
she still is in objects for her best affections, I trust the void will not 
be long or severely felt.&nbsp; She must think, not of what she has lost, 
but of what she possesses.&nbsp; With eight fine children, how can she ever
be poor or solitary!&mdash;Believe me, dear sir, yours sincerely,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I own I was glad to
receive your assurance that the Calcutta paper&rsquo;s surmise was 
unfounded. <a name="citation398"></a><a href="#footnote398" 
class="citation">[398]</a>&nbsp; It is said that when we <i>wish</i> a 
thing to be true, we are prone to believe it true; but I think (judging 
from myself) we adopt with a still prompter credulity the rumour which 
shocks.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very kind in Dr. Forbes to give me his book.&nbsp; I hope 
Mr. Smith will have the goodness to convey my thanks for the present.&nbsp;
You can keep it to send with the next parcel, or perhaps I may be in London
myself before May is over.&nbsp; That invitation I mentioned in a previous 
letter is still urged upon me, and well as I know what penance its 
acceptance would entail in some points, I also know the advantage it would 
bring in others.&nbsp; My conscience tells me it would be <!-- page 
399--><a name="page399"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 399</span>the act of a
moral poltroon to let the fear of suffering stand in the way of 
improvement.&nbsp; But suffer I shall.&nbsp; No matter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The perusal of <i>Southey&rsquo;s Life</i> has lately afforded me
much pleasure.&nbsp; The autobiography with which it commences is deeply 
interesting, and the letters which follow are scarcely less so, disclosing 
as they do a character most estimable in its integrity and a nature most 
amiable in its benevolence, as well as a mind admirable in its 
talent.&nbsp; Some people assert that genius is inconsistent with domestic 
happiness, and yet Southey was happy at home and made his home happy; he 
not only loved his wife and children <i>though</i> he was a poet, but he 
loved them the better <i>because</i> he was a poet.&nbsp; He seems to have 
been without taint of worldliness.&nbsp; London with its pomps and 
vanities, learned coteries with their dry pedantry, rather scared than 
attracted him.&nbsp; He found his prime glory in his genius, and his chief 
felicity in home affections.&nbsp; I like Southey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have likewise read one of Miss Austen&rsquo;s 
works&mdash;<i>Emma</i>&mdash;read it with interest and with just the 
degree of admiration which Miss Austen herself would have thought sensible 
and suitable.&nbsp; Anything like warmth or enthusiasm&mdash;anything 
energetic, poignant, heart-felt is utterly out of place in commending these
works: all such demonstration the authoress would have met with a well-bred
sneer, would have calmly scorned as <i>outr&eacute;</i> and 
extravagant.&nbsp; She does her business of delineating the surface of the 
lives of genteel English people curiously well.&nbsp; There is a Chinese 
fidelity, a miniature delicacy in the painting.&nbsp; She ruffles her 
reader by nothing vehement, disturbs him by nothing profound.&nbsp; The 
passions are perfectly unknown to her; she rejects even a speaking 
acquaintance with that stormy sisterhood.&nbsp; Even to the feelings she 
vouchsafes no more than an occasional graceful but distant 
recognition&mdash;too frequent converse with them would ruffle the smooth 
elegance of her progress.&nbsp; Her business is not half so much with the 
human heart as with the human eyes, mouth, hands, and feet.&nbsp; What sees
keenly, speaks aptly, moves flexibly, it suits her to study; but what 
throbs fast and full, though hidden, what the blood rushes through, what is
the unseen <!-- page 400--><a name="page400"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
400</span>seat of life and the sentient target of death&mdash;this Miss 
Austen ignores.&nbsp; She no more, with her mind&rsquo;s eye, beholds the 
heart of her race than each man, with bodily vision, sees the heart in his 
heaving breast.&nbsp; Jane Austen was a complete and most sensible lady, 
but a very incomplete and rather insensible (<i>not senseless</i>) 
woman.&nbsp; If this is heresy, I cannot help it.&nbsp; If I said it to 
some people (Lewes for instance) they would directly accuse me of 
advocating exaggerated heroics, but I am not afraid of your falling into 
any such vulgar error.&mdash;Believe me, yours sincerely,</p>

John Russell&rsquo;s letter with very great zest and relish, and think him 
a spirited sensible little man for writing it.&nbsp; He makes no 
old-womanish outcry of alarm and expresses no exaggerated wrath.&nbsp; One 
of the best paragraphs is that which refers to the Bishop of London and the
Puseyites.&nbsp; Oh! I wish Dr. Arnold were yet living, or that a second

his imaginative forehead and somewhat foolish-looking <!-- page 401--><a

403</span>CHAPTER XV: WILLIAM MAKEPEACE THACKERAY</h2>
<p>The devotion of Charlotte Bront&euml; to Thackeray, or rather to 
Thackeray&rsquo;s genius, is a pleasant episode in literary history.&nbsp; 
In 1848 he sent Miss Bront&euml;, as we have seen, a copy of <i>Vanity 
Fair</i>.&nbsp; In 1852 he sent her a copy of <i>Esmond</i>, with the more 
cordial inscription which came of friendship.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The second edition of <i>Jane Eyre</i> was dedicated to him as possessed
of &lsquo;an intellect profounder and more unique than his contemporaries 
have yet recognised,&rsquo; and as &lsquo;the first social regenerator of 
the day.&rsquo;&nbsp; And when Currer Bell was dead, it was Thackeray who 
wrote by far the most eloquent tribute to her memory.&nbsp; When a copy of 
Lawrence&rsquo;s portrait of Thackeray <a name="citation403"></a><a 
href="#footnote403" class="citation">[403]</a> was sent to Haworth by Mr. 
George Smith, Charlotte Bront&euml; stood in front of it and, half 
playfully, half seriously, shook her fist, apostrophising its original as 
&lsquo;Thou Titan!&rsquo;</p>
<p>With all this hero-worship, it may be imagined that no <!-- page 
404--><a name="page404"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 404</span>favourable 
criticism gave her more unqualified pleasure than that which came from her 
&lsquo;master,&rsquo; as she was not indisposed to consider one who was 
only seven years her senior, and whose best books were practically 
contemporaneous with her own.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>October</i> 28<i>th</i>, 1847.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your last letter was 
very pleasant to me to read, and is very cheering to reflect on.&nbsp; I 
feel honoured in being approved by Mr. Thackeray, because I approve Mr. 
Thackeray.&nbsp; This may sound presumptuous perhaps, but I mean that I 
have long recognised in his writings genuine talent, such as I admired, 
such as I wondered at and delighted in.&nbsp; No author seems to 
distinguish so exquisitely as he does dross from ore, the real from the 
counterfeit.&nbsp; I believed too he had deep and true feelings under his 
seeming sternness.&nbsp; Now I am sure he has.&nbsp; One good word from 
such a man is worth pages of praise from ordinary judges.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are right in having faith in the reality of Helen 
Burns&rsquo;s character; she was real enough.&nbsp; I have exaggerated 
nothing there.&nbsp; I abstained from recording much that I remember 
respecting her, lest the narrative should sound incredible.&nbsp; Knowing 
this, I could not but smile at the quiet self-complacent dogmatism with 
which one of the journals lays it down that &ldquo;such creations as Helen 
Burns are very beautiful but very untrue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The plot of <i>Jane Eyre</i> may be a hackneyed one.&nbsp; Mr. 
Thackeray remarks that it is familiar to him.&nbsp; But having read 
comparatively few novels, I never chanced to meet with it, and I thought it
original.&nbsp; The work referred to by the critic of the 
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, I had not had the good fortune to hear of.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The <i>Weekly Chronicle</i> seems inclined to identify me with 
Mrs. Marsh.&nbsp; I never had the pleasure of perusing a line of Mrs. 
Marsh&rsquo;s in my life, but I wish very much to read her works, and shall
profit by the first opportunity of doing so.&nbsp; I hope I shall not find 
I have been an unconscious imitator.</p>
<p><!-- page 405--><a name="page405"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
405</span>&lsquo;I would still endeavour to keep my expectations low 
respecting the ultimate success of <i>Jane Eyre</i>.&nbsp; But my desire 
that it should succeed augments, for you have taken much trouble about the 
work, and it would grieve me seriously if your active efforts should be 
baffled and your sanguine hopes disappointed.&nbsp; Excuse me if I again 
remark that I fear they are rather <i>too</i> sanguine; it would be better 
to moderate them.&nbsp; What will the critics of the monthly reviews and 
magazines be likely to see in <i>Jane Eyre</i> (if indeed they deign to 
read it), which will win from them even a stinted modicum of 
approbation?&nbsp; It has no learning, no research, it discusses no subject
of public interest.&nbsp; A mere domestic novel will, I fear, seem trivial 
to men of large views and solid attainments.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still, efforts so energetic and indefatigable as yours ought to 
realise a result in some degree favourable, and I trust they will.&mdash;I 
remain, dear sir, yours respectfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. Bell</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>October</i> 28<i>th</i>, 1847.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have just received the <i>Tablet</i> and the <i>Morning 
Advertiser</i>.&nbsp; Neither paper seems inimical to the book, but I see 
it produces a very different effect on different natures.&nbsp; I was 
amused at the analysis in the <i>Tablet</i>, it is oddly expressed in some 
parts.&nbsp; I think the critic did not always seize my meaning; he speaks,
for instance, of &ldquo;Jane&rsquo;s inconceivable alarm at Mr. 
Rochester&rsquo;s repelling manner.&rdquo;&nbsp; I do not remember 
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>December</i> 11<i>th</i>, 1847.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have delayed writing
to you in the hope that the parcel you sent would reach me; but after 
making due inquiries at the Keighley, Bradford, and Leeds Stations and 
obtaining no news of it, I must conclude that it has been lost.</p>
<p>&lsquo;However, I have contrived to get a sight of <i>Fraser&rsquo;s 
Magazine</i> from another quarter, so that I have only to regret Mr. 
Home&rsquo;s kind present.&nbsp; Will you thank that gentleman for me when 
you see him, and tell him that the railroad is to blame for my not having 
acknowledged his courtesy before?</p>
<p><!-- page 406--><a name="page406"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
406</span>&lsquo;Mr. Lewes is very lenient: I anticipated a degree of 
severity which he has spared me.&nbsp; This notice differs from all the 
other notices.&nbsp; He must be a man of no ordinary mind: there is a 
strange sagacity evinced in some of his remarks; yet he is not always 
right.&nbsp; I am afraid if he knew how much I write from intuition, how 
little from actual knowledge, he would think me presumptuous ever to have 
written at all.&nbsp; I am sure such would be his opinion if he knew the 
narrow bounds of my attainments, the limited scope of my reading.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are moments when I can hardly credit that anything I have 
done should be found worthy to give even transitory pleasure to such men as
Mr. Thackeray, Sir John Herschel, Mr. Fonblanque, Leigh Hunt, and Mr. 
Lewes&mdash;that my humble efforts should have had such a result is a noble
reward.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was glad and proud to get the bank bill Mr. Smith sent me 
yesterday, but I hardly ever felt delight equal to that which cheered me 
when I received your letter containing an extract from a note by Mr. 
Thackeray, in which he expressed himself gratified with the perusal of 
<i>Jane Eyre</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Thackeray is a keen ruthless satirist.&nbsp; I 
had never perused his writings but with blended feelings of admiration and 
indignation.&nbsp; Critics, it appears to me, do not know what an 
intellectual boa-constrictor he is.&nbsp; They call him 
&ldquo;humorous,&rdquo; &ldquo;brilliant&rdquo;&mdash;his is a most 
scalping humour, a most deadly brilliancy: he does not play with his prey, 
he coils round it and crushes it in his rings.&nbsp; He seems terribly in 
earnest in his war against the falsehood and follies of &ldquo;the 
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; I often wonder what that &ldquo;world&rdquo; thinks of 
him.&nbsp; I should think the faults of such a man would be distrust of 
anything good in human nature&mdash;galling suspicion of bad motives 
lurking behind good actions.&nbsp; Are these his failings?</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are, at any rate, the failings of his written sentiments, 
for he cannot find in his heart to represent either man or woman as at once
good and wise.&nbsp; Does he not too much confound benevolence with 
weakness and wisdom with mere craft?</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I must not intrude on your time by too long a 
letter.&mdash;Believe me, yours respectfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. Bell</span>.</p>
<p><!-- page 407--><a name="page407"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
407</span>&lsquo;I have received the <i>Sheffield Iris</i>, the <i>Bradford
Observer</i>, the <i>Guardian</i>, the <i>Newcastle Guardian</i>, and the 
<i>Sunday Times</i> since you wrote.&nbsp; The contrast between the notices
in the two last named papers made me smile.&nbsp; The <i>Sunday Times</i> 
almost denounces <i>Jane Eyre</i> as something very reprehensible and 
obnoxious, whereas the <i>Newcastle Guardian</i> seems to think it a mild 
potion which may be &ldquo;safely administered to the most delicate 
invalid.&rdquo;&nbsp; I suppose the public must decide when critics 
disagree.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am glad that you and
Messrs. Smith &amp; Elder approve the second preface.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I send an errata of the first volume, and part of the 
second.&nbsp; I will send the rest of the corrections as soon as 
possible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will the inclosed dedication suffice?&nbsp; I have made it brief,
because I wished to avoid any appearance of pomposity or pretension.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The notice in the <i>Church of England Journal</i> gratified me 
much, and chiefly because it <i>was</i> the <i>Church of England 
Journal</i>.&nbsp; Whatever such critics as he of the <i>Mirror</i> may 
say, I love the Church of England.&nbsp; Her ministers, indeed, I do not 
regard as infallible personages, I have seen too much of them for that, but
to the Establishment, with all her faults&mdash;the profane Athanasian 
creed <i>ex</i>cluded&mdash;I am sincerely attached.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is the forthcoming critique on Mr. Thackeray&rsquo;s writings in 
the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> written by Mr. Lewes?&nbsp; I hope it is.&nbsp;
Mr. Lewes, with his penetrating sagacity and fine acumen, ought to be able 
to do the author of <i>Vanity Fair</i> justice.&nbsp; Only he must not 
bring him down to the level of Fielding&mdash;he is far, far above 
Fielding.&nbsp; It appears to me that Fielding&rsquo;s style is arid, and 
his views of life and human nature coarse, compared with 
Thackeray&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With many thanks for your kind wishes, and a cordial 
reciprocation of them,&mdash;I remain, dear sir, yours respectfully,</p>

partly to blame for this&mdash;my fingers are numb.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The dedication here referred to is that to Thackeray.&nbsp; People had 
been already suggesting that the book might have been written by Thackeray 
under a pseudonym; others had implied, knowing that there was 
&lsquo;something about a woman&rsquo; in Thackeray&rsquo;s life, that it 
was written by a mistress of the great novelist.&nbsp; Indeed, the 
<i>Quarterly</i> had half hinted as much.&nbsp; Currer Bell, knowing 
nothing of the gossip of London, had dedicated her book in single-minded 
enthusiasm.&nbsp; Her distress was keen when it was revealed to her that 
the wife of Mr. Thackeray, like the wife of Rochester in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, 
was of unsound mind.&nbsp; However, a correspondence with him would seem to
have ended amicably enough. <a name="citation408"></a><a

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>January</i> 28<i>th</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I need not tell you 
that when I saw Mr. Thackeray&rsquo;s letter inclosed under your cover, the
sight made me very happy.&nbsp; It was some time before I dared open it, 
lest my pleasure in receiving it should be mixed with pain on learning its 
contents&mdash;lest, in short, the dedication should have been, in some 
way, unacceptable to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, to tell you the truth, I fear this must have been the case; 
he does not say so, his letter is most friendly in its noble simplicity, 
but he apprises me, at the commencement, of a circumstance which both 
surprised and dismayed me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose it is no indiscretion to tell you this circumstance, 
<!-- page 409--><a name="page409"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
409</span>for you doubtless know it already.&nbsp; It appears that his 
private position is in some points similar to that I have ascribed to Mr. 
Rochester; that thence arose a report that <i>Jane Eyre</i> had been 
written by a governess in his family, and that the dedication coming now 
has confirmed everybody in the surmise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well may it be said that fact is often stranger than 
fiction!&nbsp; The coincidence struck me as equally unfortunate and 
extraordinary.&nbsp; Of course I knew nothing whatever of Mr. 
Thackeray&rsquo;s domestic concerns, he existed for me only as an 
author.&nbsp; Of all regarding his personality, station, connections, 
private history, I was, and am still in a great measure, totally in the 
dark; but I am <i>very very</i> sorry that my inadvertent blunder should 
have made his name and affairs a subject for common gossip.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The very fact of his not complaining at all and addressing me 
with such kindness, notwithstanding the pain and annoyance I must have 
caused him, increases my chagrin.&nbsp; I could not half express my regret 
to him in my answer, for I was restrained by the consciousness that that 
regret was just worth nothing at all&mdash;quite valueless for healing the 
mischief I had done.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you tell me anything more on this subject? or can you guess 
in what degree the unlucky coincidence would affect him&mdash;whether it 
would pain him much and deeply; for he says so little himself on the topic,
I am at a loss to divine the exact truth&mdash;but I fear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not think, my dear sir, from my silence respecting the advice 
you have, at different times, given me for my future literary guidance, 
that I am heedless of, or indifferent to, your kindness.&nbsp; I keep your 
letters and not unfrequently refer to them.&nbsp; Circumstances may render 
it impracticable for me to act up to the letter of what you counsel, but I 
think I comprehend the spirit of your precepts, and trust I shall be able 
to profit thereby.&nbsp; Details, situations which I do not understand and 
cannot personally inspect, I would not for the world meddle with, lest I 
should make even a more ridiculous mess of the matter than Mrs. Trollope 
did in her <i>Factory Boy</i>.&nbsp; Besides, not one feeling on any 
subject, public or private, will I ever <!-- page 410--><a 
name="page410"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 410</span>affect that I do not 
really experience.&nbsp; Yet though I must limit my sympathies; though my 
observation cannot penetrate where the very deepest political and social 
truths are to be learnt; though many doors of knowledge which are open for 
you are for ever shut for me; though I must guess and calculate and grope 
my way in the dark, and come to uncertain conclusions unaided and alone 
where such writers as Dickens and Thackeray, having access to the shrine 
and image of Truth, have only to go into the temple, lift the veil a 
moment, and come out and say what they have seen&mdash;yet with every 
disadvantage, I mean still, in my own contracted way, to do my best.&nbsp; 
Imperfect my best will be, and poor, and compared with the works of the 
true masters&mdash;of that greatest modern master Thackeray in especial 
(for it is him I at heart reverence with all my strength)&mdash;it will be 
trifling, but I trust not affected or counterfeit.&mdash;Believe me, my 
dear sir, yours with regard and respect,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Currer

<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>March</i> 29<i>th</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The notice from the
<i>Church of England Quarterly Review</i> is not on the whole a bad 
one.&nbsp; True, it condemns the tendency of <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and seems to
think Mr. Rochester should have been represented as going through the 
mystic process of &ldquo;regeneration&rdquo; before any respectable person 
could have consented to believe his contrition for his past errors sincere;
true, also, that it casts a doubt on Jane&rsquo;s creed, and leaves it 
doubtful whether she was Hindoo, Mahommedan, or infidel.&nbsp; But 
notwithstanding these eccentricities, it is a conscientious notice, very 
unlike that in the <i>Mirror</i>, for instance, which seemed the result of 
a feeble sort of spite, whereas this is the critic&rsquo;s real opinion: 
some of the ethical and theological notions are not according to his 
system, and he disapproves of them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to hear that Mr. Lewes&rsquo;s new work is soon to 
appear, and pleased also to learn that Messrs. Smith &amp; Elder are the 
publishers.&nbsp; Mr. Lewes mentioned in the last note I received from him 
that he had just finished writing his <!-- page 411--><a 
name="page411"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 411</span>new novel, and I have
been on the look out for the advertisement of its appearance ever 
since.&nbsp; I shall long to read it, if it were only to get a further 
insight into the author&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; I read <i>Ranthorpe</i> 
with lively interest&mdash;there was much true talent in its pages.&nbsp; 
Two thirds of it I thought excellent, the latter part seemed more hastily 
and sketchily written.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I trust Miss Kavanagh&rsquo;s work will meet with the success 
that, from your account, I am certain she and it deserve.&nbsp; I think I 
have met with an outline of the facts on which her tale is founded in some 
periodical, <i>Chambers&rsquo; Journal</i> I believe.&nbsp; No critic, 
however rigid, will find fault with &ldquo;the tendency&rdquo; of her work,
I should think.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will tell you why you cannot fully sympathise with the French, 
or feel any firm confidence in their future movements: because too few of 
them are Lamartines, too many Ledru Rollins.&nbsp; That, at least, is my 
reason for watching their proceedings with more dread than hope.&nbsp; With
the Germans it is different: to their rational and justifiable efforts for 
liberty one can heartily wish well.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seems, as you say, as if change drew near England too.&nbsp; 
She is divided by the sea from the lands where it is making thrones rock, 
but earthquakes roll lower than the ocean, and we know neither the day nor 
the hour when the tremor and heat, passing beneath our island, may unsettle
and dissolve its foundations.&nbsp; Meantime, one thing is certain, all 
will in the end work together for good.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mention Thackeray and the last number of <i>Vanity 
Fair</i>.&nbsp; The more I read Thackeray&rsquo;s works the more certain I 
am that he stands alone&mdash;alone in his sagacity, alone in his truth, 
alone in his feeling (his feeling, though he makes no noise about it, is 
about the most genuine that ever lived on a printed page), alone in his 
power, alone in his simplicity, alone in his self-control.&nbsp; Thackeray 
is a Titan, so strong that he can afford to perform with calm the most 
herculean feats; there is the charm and majesty of repose in his greatest 
efforts; <i>he</i> borrows nothing from fever, his is never the energy of 
delirium&mdash;his energy is sane <!-- page 412--><a 
name="page412"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 412</span>energy, deliberate 
energy, thoughtful energy.&nbsp; The last number of <i>Vanity Fair</i> 
proves this peculiarly.&nbsp; Forcible, exciting in its force, still more 
impressive than exciting, carrying on the interest of the narrative in a 
flow, deep, full, resistless, it is still quiet&mdash;as quiet as 
reflection, as quiet as memory; and to me there are parts of it that sound 
as solemn as an oracle.&nbsp; Thackeray is never borne away by his own 
ardour&mdash;he has it under control.&nbsp; His genius obeys him&mdash;it 
is his servant, it works no fantastic changes at its own wild will, it must
still achieve the task which reason and sense assign it, and none 
other.&nbsp; Thackeray is unique.&nbsp; I <i>can</i> say no more, I 
<i>will</i> say no less.&mdash;Believe me, yours sincerely,</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your generous indignation against the <i>Quarterly</i> touched 
me.&nbsp; But do not trouble yourself to be angry on Currer Bell&rsquo;s 
account; except where the May-Fair gossip and Mr. Thackeray&rsquo;s name 
were brought in he was never stung at all, but he certainly thought that 
passage and one or two others quite unwarrantable.&nbsp; However, slander 
without a germ of truth is seldom injurious: it resembles a rootless plant 
and must soon wither away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The critic would certainly be a little ashamed of herself if she 
knew what foolish blunders she had committed, if she were aware how 
completely Mr. Thackeray and Currer Bell are strangers to each other, that 
<i>Jane Eyre</i> was written before the author had seen one line of 
<i>Vanity Fair</i>, or that if C. Bell had known that there existed in Mr. 
Thackeray&rsquo;s private circumstances the shadow of a reason for fancying
personal allusion, so far from dedicating the book to that gentleman, he 
would have regarded such a step as ill-judged, insolent, and indefensible, 
and would have shunned it accordingly.&mdash;Believe me, my dear sir, yours

<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>August</i> 14<i>th</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;My sister Anne 
thanks you, as well as myself, for your just critique on <i>Wildfell 
Hall</i>.&nbsp; It appears to me <!-- page 413--><a 
name="page413"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 413</span>that your 
observations exactly hit both the strong and weak points of the book, and 
the advice which accompanies them is worthy of, and shall receive, our most
careful attention.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The first duty of an author is, I conceive, a faithful allegiance
to Truth and Nature; his second, such a conscientious study of Art as shall
enable him to interpret eloquently and effectively the oracles delivered by
those two great deities.&nbsp; The Bells are very sincere in their worship 
of Truth, and they hope to apply themselves to the consideration of Art, so
as to attain one day the power of speaking the language of conviction in 
the accents of persuasion; though they rather apprehend that whatever pains
they take to modify and soften, an abrupt word or vehement tone will now 
and then occur to startle ears polite, whenever the subject shall chance to
be such as moves their spirits within them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have already told you, I believe, that I regard Mr. Thackeray 
as the first of modern masters, and as the legitimate high priest of Truth;
I study him accordingly with reverence.&nbsp; He, I see, keeps the 
mermaid&rsquo;s tail below water, and only hints at the dead men&rsquo;s 
bones and noxious slime amidst which it wriggles; <i>but</i>, his hint is 
more vivid than other men&rsquo;s elaborate explanations, and never is his 
satire whetted to so keen an edge as when with quiet mocking irony he 
modestly recommends to the approbation of the public his own exemplary 
discretion and forbearance.&nbsp; The world begins to know Thackeray rather
better than it did two years or even a year ago, but as yet it only half 
knows him.&nbsp; His mind seems to me a fabric as simple and unpretending 
as it is deep-founded and enduring&mdash;there is no meretricious ornament 
to attract or fix a superficial glance; his great distinction of the 
genuine is one that can only be fully appreciated with time.&nbsp; There is
something, a sort of &ldquo;still profound,&rdquo; revealed in the 
concluding part of <i>Vanity Fair</i> which the discernment of one 
generation will not suffice to fathom.&nbsp; A hundred years hence, if he 
only lives to do justice to himself, he will be better known than he is 
now.&nbsp; A hundred years hence, some thoughtful critic, standing and 
looking down on the deep waters, will see shining through them the pearl 
without <!-- page 414--><a name="page414"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
414</span>price of a purely original mind&mdash;such a mind as the Bulwers,
etc., his contemporaries have <i>not</i>,&mdash;not acquirements gained 
from study, but the thing that came into the world with him&mdash;his 
inherent genius: the thing that made him, I doubt not, different as a child
from other children, that caused him, perhaps, peculiar griefs and 
struggles in life, and that now makes him as a writer unlike other 
writers.&nbsp; Excuse me for recurring to this theme, I do not wish to bore
you.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You say Mr. Huntingdon reminds you of Mr. Rochester.&nbsp; Does 
he?&nbsp; Yet there is no likeness between the two; the foundation of each 
character is entirely different.&nbsp; Huntingdon is a specimen of the 
naturally selfish, sensual, superficial man, whose one merit of a joyous 
temperament only avails him while he is young and healthy, whose best days 
are his earliest, who never profits by experience, who is sure to grow 
worse the older he grows.&nbsp; Mr. Rochester has a thoughtful nature and a
very feeling heart; he is neither selfish nor self-indulgent; he is 
ill-educated, misguided; errs, when he does err, through rashness and 
inexperience: he lives for a time as too many other men live, but being 
radically better than most men, he does not like that degraded life, and is
never happy in it.&nbsp; He is taught the severe lessons of experience and 
has sense to learn wisdom from them.&nbsp; Years improve him; the 
effervescence of youth foamed away, what is really good in him still 
remains.&nbsp; His nature is like wine of a good vintage: time cannot sour,
but only mellows him.&nbsp; Such at least was the character I meant to 
pourtray.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heathcliffe, again, of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> is quite another 
creation.&nbsp; He exemplifies the effects which a life of continued 
injustice and hard usage may produce on a naturally perverse, vindictive, 
and inexorable disposition.&nbsp; Carefully trained and kindly treated, the
black gipsy-cub might possibly have been reared into a human being, but 
tyranny and ignorance made of him a mere demon.&nbsp; The worst of it is, 
some of his spirit seems breathed through the whole narrative in which he 
figures: it haunts every moor and glen, and beckons in every fir-tree of 
the Heights.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must not forget to thank you for the <i>Examiner</i> and 
<i>Atlas</i> <!-- page 415--><a name="page415"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
415</span>newspapers.&nbsp; Poor Mr. Newby!&nbsp; It is not enough that the
<i>Examiner</i> nails him by both ears to the pillory, but the <i>Atlas</i>
brands a token of disgrace on his forehead.&nbsp; This is a deplorable 
plight, and he makes all matters worse by his foolish little answers to his
assailants.&nbsp; It is a pity that he has no kind friend to suggest to him
that he had better not bandy words with the <i>Examiner</i>.&nbsp; His plea
about the &ldquo;printer&rdquo; was too ludicrous, and his second note is 
pitiable.&nbsp; I only regret that the names of Ellis and Acton Bell should
perforce be mixed up with his proceedings.&nbsp; My sister Anne wishes me 
to say that should she ever write another work, Mr. Smith will certainly 
have the first offer of the copyright.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s health is more satisfactory than 
when you last wrote.&nbsp; With every good wish to yourself and your 
family,&mdash;Believe me, my dear sir, yours sincerely,</p>

<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>October</i> 19<i>th</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am again at home;
and after the first sensations consequent on returning to a place more dumb
and vacant than it once was, I am beginning to feel settled.&nbsp; I think 
the contrast with London does not make Haworth more desolate; on the 
contrary, I have gleaned ideas, images, pleasant feelings, such as may 
perhaps cheer many a long winter evening.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ask my opinion of your daughters.&nbsp; I wish I could give 
you one worth acceptance.&nbsp; A single evening&rsquo;s acquaintance does 
not suffice with me to form an <i>opinion</i>, it only leaves on my mind an
<i>impression</i>.&nbsp; They impressed me, then, as pleasing in manners 
and appearance: Ellen&rsquo;s is a character to which I could soon attach 
myself, and Fanny and Louisa have each their separate advantages.&nbsp; I 
can, however, read more in a face like Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s than in the 
smooth young features of her daughters&mdash;time, trial, and exertion 
write a distinct hand, more legible than smile or dimple.&nbsp; I was told 
you had once some thoughts of bringing out Fanny as a professional singer, 
and it was added Fanny did not like the project.&nbsp; I <!-- page 416--><a
name="page416"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 416</span>thought to myself, if
she does not like it, it can never be successfully executed.&nbsp; It seems
to me that to achieve triumph in a career so arduous, the artist&rsquo;s 
own bent to the course must be inborn, decided, resistless.&nbsp; There 
should be no urging, no goading; native genius and vigorous will should 
lend their wings to the aspirant&mdash;nothing less can lift her to real 
fame, and who would rise feebly only to fall ignobly?&nbsp; An inferior 
artist, I am sure, you would not wish your daughter to be, and if she is to
stand in the foremost rank, only her own courage and resolve can place her 
there; so, at least, the case appears to me.&nbsp; Fanny probably looks on 
publicity as degrading, and I believe that for a woman it is degrading if 
it is not glorious.&nbsp; If I could not be a Lind, I would not be a 
singer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Brief as my visit to London was, it must for me be 
memorable.&nbsp; I sometimes fancied myself in a dream&mdash;I could 
scarcely credit the reality of what passed.&nbsp; For instance, when I 
walked into the room and put my hand into Miss Martineau&rsquo;s, the 
action of saluting her and the fact of her presence seemed visionary.&nbsp;
Again, when Mr. Thackeray was announced, and I saw him enter, looked up at 
his tall figure, heard his voice, the whole incident was truly dream-like, 
I was only certain it was true because I became miserably destitute of 
self-possession.&nbsp; Amour propre suffers terribly under such 
circumstances: woe to him that thinks of himself in the presence of 
intellectual greatness!&nbsp; Had I not been obliged to speak, I could have
managed well, but it behoved me to answer when addressed, and the effort 
was torture&mdash;I spoke stupidly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to the band of critics, I cannot say they overawed me much; I 
enjoyed the spectacle of them greatly.&nbsp; The two contrasts, Forster and
Chorley, have each a certain edifying carriage and conversation good to 
contemplate.&nbsp; I by no means dislike Mr. Forster&mdash;quite the 
contrary, but the distance from his loud swagger to Thackeray&rsquo;s 
simple port is as the distance from Shakespeare&rsquo;s writing to 
Macready&rsquo;s acting.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Chorley tantalised me.&nbsp; He is a peculiar 
specimen&mdash;one whom you could set yourself to examine, uncertain 
whether, when you had probed all the small recesses of his character, <!-- 
page 417--><a name="page417"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 417</span>the 
result would be utter contempt and aversion, or whether for the sake of 
latent good you would forgive obvious evil.&nbsp; One could well pardon his
unpleasant features, his strange voice, even his very foppery and grimace, 
if one found these disadvantages connected with living talent and any spark
of genuine goodness.&nbsp; If there is nothing more than acquirement, 
smartness, and the affectation of philanthropy, Chorley is a fine 
creature.</p>

me, yours sincerely,</p>

<i>December</i> 19<i>th</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;Here I am at Haworth
once more.&nbsp; I feel as if I had come out of an exciting whirl.&nbsp; 
Not that the hurry or stimulus would have seemed much to one accustomed to 
society and change, but to me they were very marked.&nbsp; My strength and 
spirits too often proved quite insufficient for the demand on their 
exertions.&nbsp; I used to bear up as well and as long as I possibly could,
for, whenever I flagged, I could see Mr. Smith became disturbed; he always 
thought that something had been said or done to annoy me, which never once 
happened, for I met with perfect good breeding even from 
antagonists&mdash;men who had done their best or worst to write me 
down.&nbsp; I explained to him, over and over again, that my occasional 
silence was only failure of the power to talk, never of the will, but still
he always seemed to fear there was another cause underneath.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Smith is rather stern, but she has sense and discrimination;
she watched me very narrowly.&nbsp; When surrounded by gentlemen she never 
took her eye from me.&nbsp; I liked the surveillance, both when it kept 
guard over me amongst many, or only with her cherished one.&nbsp; She soon,
I am convinced, saw in what light I received all, Thackeray included.&nbsp;
Her &ldquo;George&rdquo; is a very fine specimen of a young English man of 
business; so I regard him, and I am proud to be one of his props.</p>
<p><!-- page 418--><a name="page418"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
418</span>&lsquo;Thackeray is a Titan of mind.&nbsp; His presence and 
powers impress me deeply in an intellectual sense; I do not see him or know
him as a man.&nbsp; All the others are subordinate to these.&nbsp; I have 
esteem for some, and, I trust, courtesy for all.&nbsp; I do not, of course,
know what they thought of me, but I believe most of them expected me to 
come out in a more marked eccentric, striking light.&nbsp; I believe they 
desired more to admire and more to blame.&nbsp; I felt sufficiently at my 
ease with all except Thackeray, and with him I was painfully stupid.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, dear Nell, when can you come to Haworth?&nbsp; Settle, and

all.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Mrs. Ellis has made
her &ldquo;morning call.&rdquo;&nbsp; I rather relished her chat about 
<i>Shirley</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i>.&nbsp; She praises reluctantly and 
blames too often affectedly.&nbsp; But whenever a reviewer betrays that he 
has been thoroughly influenced and stirred by the work he criticises, it is
easy to forgive the rest&mdash;hate and personality excepted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have received and perused the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>&mdash;it 
is very brutal and savage.&nbsp; I am not angry with Lewes, but I wish in 
future he would let me alone, and not write again what makes me feel so 
cold and sick as I am feeling just now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thackeray&rsquo;s Christmas Book at once grieved and pleased me, 
as most of his writings do.&nbsp; I have come to the conclusion that 
whenever he writes, Mephistopheles stands on his right hand and Raphael on 
his left; the great doubter and sneerer usually guides the pen, the Angel, 
noble and gentle, interlines letters of light here and there.&nbsp; Alas! 
Thackeray, I wish your strong wings would lift you oftener above the smoke

one from Lewes and one from Sir J. K. Shuttleworth, both which peruse and

Thackeray, long, interesting, characteristic, but it unfortunately 
concludes with the strict injunction, <i>show this letter to no one</i>, 
adding that if he thought his letters were seen by others, he should either
cease to write or write only what was conventional; but for this 
circumstance I should have sent it with the others.&nbsp; I answered it at 
length.&nbsp; Whether my reply will give satisfaction or displeasure 
remains yet to be ascertained.&nbsp; Thackeray&rsquo;s feelings are not 
such as can be gauged by ordinary calculation: variable weather is what I 
should ever expect from that quarter, yet in correspondence as in verbal

<p>It cannot be said that Charlotte Bront&euml; and Thackeray gained by 
personal contact.&nbsp; &lsquo;With him I was painfully stupid,&rsquo; she 
says.&nbsp; It was the case of Heine and Goethe over again.&nbsp; Heine in 
the presence of the king of German literature could talk only of the plums 
in the garden.&nbsp; Charlotte Bront&euml; in the presence of her hero 
Thackeray could not express herself with the vigour and intelligence which 
belonged to her correspondence with Mr. Williams.&nbsp; Miss Bront&euml;, 
again, was hyper-critical of the smaller vanities of men, and, as has been 
pointed out, she emphasised in <i>Villette</i> a trivial piece of not 
unpleasant egotism on Thackeray&rsquo;s part after a lecture&mdash;his 
asking her if she had liked it.&nbsp; This question, which nine men out of 
ten would be prone to ask of a woman friend, was 
&lsquo;over-eagerness&rsquo; and &lsquo;<i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>&rsquo; 
in her eyes.&nbsp; Thackeray, on his side, found conversation difficult, if
we may judge by a reminiscence by his daughter Mrs. Ritchie:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;One of the most notable persons who ever came into our 
bow-windowed drawing-room in Young Street is a guest never to be forgotten 
by me&mdash;a tiny, delicate, little person, whose small hand nevertheless 
grasped a mighty lever which set all the literary world of that day 
vibrating.&nbsp; I can still see the scene quite plainly&mdash;the hot 
summer evening, the open windows, the carriage driving to the door as we 
all sat silent and expectant; my father, who rarely waited, waiting with 
us; our governess and my sister and I all in a row, and prepared for the 
great event.&nbsp; We saw the carriage stop, and out of it sprang the 
active well-knit figure of Mr. George Smith, who was bringing Miss 
Bront&euml; to see our father.&nbsp; My father, who had been walking up and
down the room, goes out into the hall to meet his guests, and then, after a
moment&rsquo;s delay, the door opens wide, and the two gentlemen come in, 
leading a tiny, delicate, serious, little lady, pale, with fair straight 
hair, and steady <!-- page 421--><a name="page421"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 421</span>eyes.&nbsp; She may be a little over thirty; 
she is dressed in a little <i>bar&egrave;ge</i> dress, with a pattern of 
faint green moss.&nbsp; She enters in mittens, in silence, in seriousness; 
our hearts are beating with wild excitement.&nbsp; This, then, is the 
authoress, the unknown power whose books have set all London talking, 
reading, speculating; some people even say our father wrote the 
books&mdash;the wonderful books.&nbsp; To say that we little girls had been
given <i>Jane Eyre</i> to read scarcely represents the facts of the case; 
to say that we had taken it without leave, read bits here and read bits 
there, been carried away by an undreamed-of and hitherto unimagined 
whirlwind into things, times, places, all utterly absorbing, and at the 
same time absolutely unintelligible to us, would more accurately describe 
our state of mind on that summer&rsquo;s evening as we look at Jane 
Eyre&mdash;the great Jane Eyre&mdash;the tiny little lady.&nbsp; The moment
is so breathless that dinner comes as a relief to the solemnity of the 
occasion, and we all smile as my father stoops to offer his arm; for, 
though genius she may be, Miss Bront&euml; can barely reach his 
elbow.&nbsp; My own personal impressions are that she is somewhat grave and
stern, especially to forward little girls who wish to chatter.&nbsp; Mr. 
George Smith has since told me how she afterwards remarked upon my 
father&rsquo;s wonderful forbearance and gentleness with our uncalled-for 
incursions into the conversation.&nbsp; She sat gazing at him with kindling
eyes of interest, lighting up with a sort of illumination every now and 
then as she answered him.&nbsp; I can see her bending forward over the 
table, not eating, but listening to what he said as he carved the dish 
before him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it must have been on this very occasion that my father 
invited some of his friends in the evening to meet Miss 
Bront&euml;&mdash;for everybody was interested and anxious to see 
her.&nbsp; Mrs. Crowe, the reciter of ghost-stories, was there.&nbsp; Mrs. 
Brookfield, Mrs. Carlyle, Mr. Carlyle himself was present, so I am told, 
railing at the appearance of cockneys upon Scotch mountain sides; there 
were also too many Americans for his taste, &ldquo;but the Americans were 
as gods compared to the cockneys,&rdquo; says the philosopher.&nbsp; 
Besides the Carlyles, there <!-- page 422--><a name="page422"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 422</span>were Mrs. Elliott and Miss Perry, Mrs. Procter
and her daughter, most of my father&rsquo;s habitual friends and 
companions.&nbsp; In the recent life of Lord Houghton I was amused to see a
note quoted in which Lord Houghton also was convened.&nbsp; Would that he 
had been present&mdash;perhaps the party would have gone off better.&nbsp; 
It was a gloomy and a silent evening.&nbsp; Every one waited for the 
brilliant conversation which never began at all.&nbsp; Miss Bront&euml; 
retired to the sofa in the study, and murmured a low word now and then to 
our kind governess, Miss Truelock.&nbsp; The room looked very dark, the 
lamp began to smoke a little, the conversation grew dimmer and more dim, 
the ladies sat round still expectant, my father was too much perturbed by 
the gloom and the silence to be able to cope with it at all.&nbsp; Mrs. 
Brookfield, who was in the doorway by the study, near the corner in which 
Miss Bront&euml; was sitting, leant forward with a little commonplace, 
since brilliance was not to be the order of the evening.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do 
you like London, Miss Bront&euml;?&rdquo; she said; another silence, a 
pause, then Miss Bront&euml; answers, &ldquo;Yes and No,&rdquo; very 
gravely.&nbsp; Mrs. Brookfield has herself reported the conversation.&nbsp;
My sister and I were much too young to be bored in those days; alarmed, 
impressed we might be, but not yet bored.&nbsp; A party was a party, a 
lioness was a lioness; and&mdash;shall I confess it?&mdash;at that time an 
extra dish of biscuits was enough to mark the evening.&nbsp; We felt all 
the importance of the occasion: tea spread in the dining-room, ladies in 
the drawing-room.&nbsp; We roamed about inconveniently, no doubt, and 
excitedly, and in one of my incursions crossing the hall, after Miss 
Bront&euml; had left, I was surprised to see my father opening the front 
door with his hat on.&nbsp; He put his fingers to his lips, walked out into
the darkness, and shut the door quietly behind him.&nbsp; When I went back 
to the drawing-room again, the ladies asked me where he was.&nbsp; I 
vaguely answered that I thought he was coming back.&nbsp; I was puzzled at 
the time, nor was it all made clear to me till long years afterwards, when 
one day Mrs. Procter asked me if I knew what had happened once when my 
father had invited a party to meet Jane Eyre at his house.&nbsp; It was one
of the <!-- page 423--><a name="page423"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
423</span>dullest evenings she had ever spent in her life, she said.&nbsp; 
And then with a good deal of humour she described the situation&mdash;the 
ladies who had all come expecting so much delightful conversation, and the 
gloom and the constraint, and how, finally, overwhelmed by the situation, 
my father had quietly left the room, left the house, and gone off to his 
club.&nbsp; The ladies waited, wondered, and finally departed also; and as 
we were going up to bed with our candles after everybody was gone, I 
remember two pretty Miss L---s, in shiny silk dresses, arriving, full of 
expectation. . . . We still said we thought our father would soon be back, 
but the Miss L---s declined to wait upon the chance, laughed, and drove 
away again almost immediately.&rsquo; <a name="citation423"></a><a

Macbeth.&nbsp; I have seen the pictures in the National Gallery.&nbsp; I 
have seen a beautiful exhibition of Turner&rsquo;s paintings, and yesterday
I saw Mr. Thackeray.&nbsp; He dined here with some other gentlemen.&nbsp; 
He is a very tall man&mdash;above six feet high, with a peculiar 
face&mdash;not handsome, very ugly indeed, generally somewhat stern and 
satirical in expression, but capable also of a kind look.&nbsp; He was not 
told who I was, he was not introduced to me, but I soon saw him looking at 
me through his spectacles; and when we all rose to go down to dinner he 
just stepped quietly up and said, &ldquo;Shake hands&rdquo;; so I shook 
hands.&nbsp; He spoke very few words to me, but when he went away he shook 
hands again in a very kind way.&nbsp; It is better, I should think, to have
him for a friend than an enemy, for he is a most formidable-looking

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Papa</span>,&mdash;I have now heard one 
of Mr. Thackeray&rsquo;s lectures and seen the great Exhibition.&nbsp; On 
Thursday afternoon I went to hear the lecture.&nbsp; It was delivered in a 
large and splendid kind of saloon&mdash;that in which the great balls of 
Almacks are given.&nbsp; The walls were all painted and gilded, the benches
were sofas stuffed and cushioned and covered with blue damask.&nbsp; The 
audience was composed of the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of London society.&nbsp; 
Duchesses were there by the score, and amongst them the great and beautiful
Duchess of Sutherland, the Queen&rsquo;s Mistress of the Robes.&nbsp; 
Amidst all this Thackeray just got up and spoke with as much simplicity and
ease as if he had been speaking to a few friends by his own fireside.&nbsp;
The lecture was truly good: he has taken pains with the composition.&nbsp; 
It was finished without being in the least studied; a quiet humour and 
graphic force enlivened it throughout.&nbsp; He saw me as I entered the 
room, and came straight up and spoke very kindly.&nbsp; He then took me to 
his mother, a fine, handsome old lady, and introduced me to her.&nbsp; 
After the lecture somebody came behind me, leaned over the bench, and said,
&ldquo;Will you permit me, as a Yorkshireman, <!-- page 425--><a 
name="page425"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 425</span>to introduce myself 
to you?&rdquo;&nbsp; I turned round, was puzzled at first by the strange 
face I met, but in a minute I recognised the features.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are
the Earl of Carlisle,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; He smiled and assented.&nbsp; He
went on to talk for some time in a courteous, kind fashion.&nbsp; He asked 
after you, recalled the platform electioneering scene at Haworth, and 
begged to be remembered to you.&nbsp; Dr. Forbes came up afterwards, and 
Mr. Monckton Milnes, a Yorkshire Member of Parliament, who introduced 
himself on the same plea as Lord Carlisle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yesterday we went to the Crystal Palace.&nbsp; The exterior has a
strange and elegant but somewhat unsubstantial effect.&nbsp; The interior 
is like a mighty Vanity Fair.&nbsp; The brightest colours blaze on all 
sides; and ware of all kinds, from diamonds to spinning jennies and 
printing presses, are there to be seen.&nbsp; It was very fine, gorgeous, 
animated, bewildering, but I liked Thackeray&rsquo;s lecture better.</p>

hear that you continued in pretty good health, and that Mr. Cartman came to
help you on Sunday.&nbsp; I fear you will not have had a very comfortable 
week in the dining-room; but by this time I suppose the parlour reformation
will be nearly completed, and you will soon be able to return to your old

Taylor.&nbsp; She continues well and happy in New Zealand, and her shop 
seems to answer well.&nbsp; The French newspaper duly arrived.&nbsp; 
Yesterday I went for the second time to the Crystal Palace.&nbsp; We 
remained in it about three hours, and I must say I was more struck with it 
on this occasion than at my first visit.&nbsp; It is a wonderful 
place&mdash;vast, strange, new, and impossible to describe.&nbsp; Its 
grandeur does not consist in <i>one</i> thing, but in the unique assemblage
of <i>all</i> things.&nbsp; <!-- page 426--><a name="page426"></a><span

there, from the great compartments filled with railway engines and boilers,
with mill-machinery in full work, with splendid carriages of all kinds, 
with harness of every description&mdash;to the glass-covered and 
velvet-spread stands loaded with the most gorgeous work of the goldsmith 
and silversmith, and the carefully guarded caskets full of real diamonds 
and pearls worth hundreds of thousands of pounds.&nbsp; It may be called a 
bazaar or a fair, but it is such a bazaar or fair as Eastern genii might 
have created.&nbsp; It seems as if magic only could have gathered this mass
of wealth from all the ends of the earth&mdash;as if none but supernatural 
hands could have arranged it thus, with such a blaze and contrast of 
colours and marvellous power of effect.&nbsp; The multitude filling the 
great aisles seems ruled and subdued by some invisible influence.&nbsp; 
Amongst the thirty thousand souls that peopled it the day I was there, not 
one loud noise was to be heard, not one irregular movement seen&mdash;the 
living tide rolls on quietly, with a deep hum like the sea heard from the 
distance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Thackeray is in high spirits about the success of his 
lectures.&nbsp; It is likely to add largely both to his fame and 
purse.&nbsp; He has, however, deferred this week&rsquo;s lecture till next 
Thursday, at the earnest petition of the duchesses and marchionesses, who, 
on the day it should have been delivered, were necessitated to go down with
the Queen and Court to Ascot Races.&nbsp; I told him I thought he did wrong
to put it off on their account&mdash;and I think so still.&nbsp; The 
amateur performance of Bulwer&rsquo;s play for the Guild of Literature has 
likewise been deferred on account of the races.&nbsp; I hope, dear papa, 
that you, Mr. Nicholls, and all at home continue well.&nbsp; Tell Martha to
take her scrubbing and cleaning in moderation and not overwork 
herself.&nbsp; With kind regards to her and Tabby,&mdash;I am, your

after.&nbsp; I have been pretty well in London, only somewhat troubled with
headaches, owing, I suppose, to the closeness and oppression of the 
air.&nbsp; The weather has not been so favourable as when I was last here, 
and in wet and dark days this great Babylon is not so cheerful.&nbsp; All 
the other sights seem to give way to the great Exhibition, into which 
thousands and tens of thousands continue to pour every day.&nbsp; I was in 
it again yesterday afternoon, and saw the ex-royal family of 
France&mdash;the old Queen, the Duchess of Orleans, and her two sons, etc.,
pass down the transept.&nbsp; I almost wonder the Londoners don&rsquo;t 
tire a little of this vast Vanity Fair&mdash;and, indeed, a new toy has 
somewhat diverted the attention of the grandees lately, viz., a fancy ball 
given last night by the Queen.&nbsp; The great lords and ladies have been 
quite wrapt up in preparations for this momentous event.&nbsp; Their pet 
and darling, Mr. Thackeray, of course sympathises with them.&nbsp; He was 
here yesterday to dinner, and left very early in the evening in order that 
he might visit respectively the Duchess of Norfolk, the Marchioness of 
Londonderry, Ladies Chesterfield and Clanricarde, and see them all in their
fancy costumes of the reign of Charles II. before they set out for the 
Palace!&nbsp; His lectures, it appears, are a triumphant success.&nbsp; He 
says they will enable him to make a provision for his daughters; and Mr. 
Smith believes he will not get less than four thousand pounds by 
them.&nbsp; He is going to give two courses, and then go to Edinburgh and 
perhaps America, but <i>not</i> under the auspices of Barnum.&nbsp; Amongst
others, the Lord Chancellor attended his last lecture, and Mr. Thackeray 
says he expects a place from him; but in this I think he was joking.&nbsp; 
Of course Mr. T. is a good deal spoiled by all this, and indeed it cannot 
be otherwise.&nbsp; He has offered two or three times to introduce me to 
some of his great friends, and says he knows many great ladies who would 
receive me with open arms if I would go to their houses; but, seriously, I 
cannot see that this sort of society produces so good an effect on him as 
to tempt me in the least to try the same experiment, so I remain 
obscure.</p>

<p>There are many pleasant references to Thackeray to be found in Mrs. 
Gaskell&rsquo;s book, including a letter to Mr. George Smith, thanking him 
for the gift of the novelist&rsquo;s portrait.&nbsp; &lsquo;He looks superb
in his beautiful, tasteful, gilded gibbet,&rsquo; she says.&nbsp; A few 
years later, and Thackeray was to write the eloquent tribute to his 
admirer, which is familiar to his readers: &lsquo;I fancied an austere 
little Joan of Arc marching in upon us and rebuking our easy lives, our 
easy morals.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;She gave me,&rsquo; he tells us, 
&lsquo;the impression of being a very pure, and lofty, and high-minded 
person.&nbsp; A great and holy reverence of right and truth seemed to be 
with her always.&nbsp; Who that has known her books has not admired the 
artist&rsquo;s noble English, the burning love of truth, the bravery, the 
simplicity, the indignation at wrong, the eager sympathy, the pious love 
and reverence, the passionate honour, so to speak, of the woman?&nbsp; What
a story is that of the family of poets in their solitude yonder on the 
gloomy Yorkshire moors!&rsquo;</p>

429</span>CHAPTER XVI: LITERARY FRIENDSHIPS</h2>
<p>There is a letter, printed by Mrs. Gaskell, from Charlotte Bront&euml; 
to Ellen Nussey, in which Miss Bront&euml;, when a girl of seventeen, 
discusses the best books to read, and expresses a particular devotion to 
Sir Walter Scott.&nbsp; During those early years she was an indefatigable 
student of literature.&nbsp; She read all that her father&rsquo;s study and
the Keighley library could provide.&nbsp; When the years brought literary 
fame and its accompanying friendships, she was able to hold her own with 
the many men and women of letters whom she was destined to meet.&nbsp; Her 
staunchest friend was undoubtedly Mr. Williams, who sent her, as we have 
seen, all the newest books from London, and who appears to have discussed 
them with her as well.&nbsp; Next to Mr. Williams we must place his chief 
at Cornhill, Mr. George Smith, and Mr. Smith&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; Mr. 
Smith happily still lives to reign over the famous house which introduced 
Thackeray, John Ruskin, and Charlotte Bront&euml; to the world.&nbsp; What 
Charlotte thought of him may be gathered from her frank acknowledgment that
he was the original of Dr. John in <i>Villette</i>, as his mother was the 
original of Mrs. Bretton&mdash;perhaps the two most entirely charming 
characters in Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s novels.&nbsp; Mrs. Smith and 
her son lived, at the beginning of the friendship, at Westbourne Place, but
afterwards removed to Gloucester Terrace, and Charlotte stayed with them at
both houses.&nbsp; It was from the former that this first letter was 
addressed.</p>

remembered that as you do not know my address you cannot write to me till 
you get it; it is as above.&nbsp; I came to this big Babylon last Thursday,
and have been in what seems to me a sort of whirl ever since; for changes, 
scenes, and stimulus which would be a trifle to others, are much to 
me.&nbsp; I found when I mentioned to Mr. Smith my plan of going to Dr. 
Wheelwright&rsquo;s it would not do at all&mdash;he would have been 
seriously hurt.&nbsp; He made his mother write to me, and thus I was 
persuaded to make my principal stay at his house.&nbsp; I have found no 
reason to regret this decision.&nbsp; Mrs. Smith received me at first like 
one who had received the strictest orders to be scrupulously 
attentive.&nbsp; I had fires in my bed-room evening and morning, wax 
candles, etc., etc.&nbsp; Mrs. Smith and her daughters seemed to look upon 
me with a mixture of respect and alarm.&nbsp; But all this is 
changed&mdash;that is to say, the attention and politeness continues as 
great as ever, but the alarm and estrangement are quite gone.&nbsp; She 
treats me as if she liked me, and I begin to like her much; kindness is a 
potent heart-winner.&nbsp; I had not judged too favourably of her son on a 
first impression; he pleases me much.&nbsp; I like him better even as a son
and brother than as a man of business.&nbsp; Mr. Williams, too, is really 
most gentlemanly and well-informed.&nbsp; His weak points he certainly has,
but these are not seen in society.&nbsp; Mr. Taylor&mdash;the little 
man&mdash;has again shown his parts; in fact, I suspect he is of the 
Helstone order of men&mdash;rigid, despotic, and self-willed.&nbsp; He 
tries to be very kind and even to express sympathy sometimes, but he does 
not manage it.&nbsp; He has a determined, dreadful nose in the middle of 
his face, which, when poked into my countenance, cuts into my soul like 
iron.&nbsp; Still, he is horribly intelligent, quick, searching, sagacious,
and with a memory of relentless tenacity.&nbsp; To turn to Mr. Williams 
after him, or to Mr. Smith himself, is to turn from granite to easy down or
warm fur.&nbsp; I have seen Thackeray.</p>

News</i>, and I believe it is to that circumstance I owe your 
letters.&nbsp; But I have now made good resolutions, which were tried this 
morning by another notice in the same style in the <i>Observer</i>.&nbsp; 
The praise of such critics mortifies more than their blame; an author who 
becomes the object of it cannot help momentarily wishing he had never 
written.&nbsp; And to speak of the press being still ignorant of my being a
woman!&nbsp; Why can they not be content to take Currer Bell for a man?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I imagined, mistakenly it now appears, that <i>Shirley</i> bore 
fewer traces of a female hand than <i>Jane Eyre</i>; that I have misjudged 
disappoints me a little, though I cannot exactly see where the error 
lies.&nbsp; You keep to your point about the curates.&nbsp; Since you think
me to blame, you do right to tell me so.&nbsp; I rather fancy I shall be 
left in a minority of one on that subject.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was indeed very much interested in the books you sent.&nbsp; 
Eckermann&rsquo;s <i>Conversations with Goethe</i>, <i>Guesses at 
Truth</i>, <i>Friends in Council</i>, and the little work on English social
life pleased me particularly, and the last not least.&nbsp; We sometimes 
take a partiality to books as to characters, not on account of any 
brilliant intellect or striking peculiarity they boast, but for the sake of
something good, delicate, and genuine.&nbsp; I thought that small book the 
production of a lady, and an amiable, sensible woman, and I like it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must not think of selecting any more works for me yet, my 
stock is still far from exhausted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I accept your offer respecting the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>; it is a
paper I should like much to see, providing you can send it without 
trouble.&nbsp; It shall be punctually returned.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaskell has much to say of Miss Bront&euml;&rsquo;s relations with 
George Henry Lewes. <a name="citation432"></a><a href="#footnote432" 
class="citation">[432]</a>&nbsp; He was a critic with whom she had much 
correspondence and not a few differences.&nbsp; It will be remembered that 
Charlotte describes him as bearing a resemblance to Emily&mdash;a curious 
circumstance by the light of the fact that Lewes was always adjudged among 
his acquaintances as a peculiarly ugly man.&nbsp; Here is a portion of a 
letter upon which Mrs. Gaskell practised considerable excisions, and of 
which she prints the remainder:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>June</i> 12<i>th</i>, 1850.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have seen Lewes.&nbsp; He is a man with both weakness and sins,
but unless I err greatly, the foundation of his nature is not bad; and were
he almost a fiend in character I could not feel otherwise to him than 
half-sadly, half-tenderly.&nbsp; A queer word that last, but I use it 
because the aspect of Lewes&rsquo;s face almost moves me to tears, it is so
wonderfully like Emily&mdash;her eyes, her features, the very nose, the 
somewhat prominent mouth, the forehead&mdash;even, at moments, the 
expression.&nbsp; Whatever Lewes does or says, I believe I cannot hate 
him.&nbsp; Another likeness I have seen, too, that touched me 
sorrowfully.&nbsp; You remember my speaking of a Miss Kavanagh, a young 
authoress, who supported her mother by her writings.&nbsp; Hearing from Mr.
Williams that she had a longing to see me, I called on her yesterday.&nbsp;
I found a little, almost dwarfish figure, to which even I had to look down;
not deformed&mdash;that is, not hunch-backed, but long-armed and with a 
large head, and (at first sight) a strange face.&nbsp; She met me 
half-frankly, half-tremblingly; we sat down together, and when I had talked
with her five minutes, <!-- page 433--><a name="page433"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 433</span>her face was no longer strange, but mournfully
familiar&mdash;it was Martha Taylor on every lineament.&nbsp; I shall try 
to find a moment to see her again.&nbsp; She lives in a poor but clean and 
neat little lodging.&nbsp; Her mother seems a somewhat weak-minded woman, 
who can be no companion to her.&nbsp; Her father has quite deserted his 
wife and child, and this poor little, feeble, intelligent, cordial thing 
wastes her brains to gain a living.&nbsp; She is twenty-five years 
old.&nbsp; I do not intend to stay here, at the furthest, more than a week 
longer; but at the end of that time I cannot go home, for the house at 
Haworth is just now unroofed; repairs were become necessary.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to go for a week or two to the sea-side, in which 
case I wonder whether it would be possible for you to join me.&nbsp; 
Meantime, with regards to all&mdash;Believe me, yours faithfully,</p>

earlier.</p>

avoid giving any clue to my place of residence, publicity not being my 
ambition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is an answer to the letter I received yesterday, favoured by 
you.&nbsp; This letter bore the signature G. H. Lewes, and the writer 
informs me that it is his intention to write a critique on <i>Jane Eyre</i>
for the December number of <i>Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, and possibly 
also, he intimates, a brief notice to the <i>Westminster Review</i>.&nbsp; 
Upon the whole he seems favourably inclined to the work, though he hints 
disapprobation of the melodramatic portions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you give me any information respecting Mr. Lewes? what 
station he occupies in the literary world and what works he has 
written?&nbsp; He styles himself &ldquo;a fellow novelist.&rdquo;&nbsp;

think well of him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I have to thank you, not merely for the gift of a little book of 
137 pages, but for that of a <i>poem</i>.&nbsp; Very real, very sweet is 
the poetry of <i>Orion</i>; there are passages I shall recur to again and 
yet again&mdash;passages instinct both with power and beauty.&nbsp; All 
through it is genuine&mdash;pure from one flaw of affectation, rich in 
noble imagery.&nbsp; How far the applause of critics has rewarded the 
author of <i>Orion</i> I do not know, but I think the pleasure he enjoyed 
in its composition must have been a bounteous meed in itself.&nbsp; You 
could not, I imagine, have written that epic without at times deriving deep
happiness from your work.</p>

the carelessness of the railroad people, to Bingley, where it lay a

to forward the <i>Mirror</i> along with <i>Fraser</i>.&nbsp; The article on
&ldquo;the last new novel&rdquo; is in substance similar to the notice in 
the <i>Sunday Times</i>.&nbsp; One passage only excited much interest in 
me; it was that where allusion is made to some former work which the author
of <i>Jane Eyre</i> is supposed to have published&mdash;there, I own, my 
curiosity was a little stimulated.&nbsp; The reviewer cannot mean the 
little book of rhymes to which Currer Bell contributed a third; but as 
that, and <i>Jane Eyre</i>, and a brief translation of some French verses 
sent anonymously to a magazine, are the sole productions of mine that have 
ever appeared in print, I am puzzled to know to what else he can refer.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The following elaborate criticism of one of Mr. Lewes&rsquo;s now 
forgotten novels is almost pathetic; it may give a modern critic pause in 
his serious treatment of the abundant literary ephemera of which we hear so
much from day to day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>May</i> 1<i>st</i>, 1848.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am glad you sent 
me your letter just as you had written it&mdash;without revisal, without 
retrenching or softening touch, because I cannot doubt that I am a gainer 
by the omission.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be useless to attempt opposition to your opinions, 
since, in fact, to read them was to recognise, almost point for point, a 
clear definition of objections I had already felt, but had found neither 
the power nor the will to express.&nbsp; Not the power, because I find it 
very difficult to analyse closely, or to criticise in appropriate words; 
and not the will, because I was afraid of <!-- page 436--><a 
name="page436"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 436</span>doing Mr. Lewes 
injustice.&nbsp; I preferred overrating to underrating the merits of his 
work.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Lewes&rsquo;s sincerity, energy, and talent assuredly command
the reader&rsquo;s respect, but on what points he depends to win his 
attachment I know not.&nbsp; I do not think he cares to excite the pleasant
feelings which incline the taught to the teacher as much in friendship as 
in reverence.&nbsp; The display of his acquirements, to which almost every 
page bears testimony&mdash;citations from Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, 
French, and German authors covering as with embroidery the texture of his 
English&mdash;awes and astonishes the plain reader; but if, in addition, 
you permit yourself to require the refining charm of delicacy, the 
elevating one of imagination&mdash;if you permit yourself to be as 
fastidious and exacting in these matters as, by your own confession, it 
appears <i>you</i> are, then Mr. Lewes must necessarily inform you that he 
does not deal in the article; probably he will add that <i>therefore</i> it
must be non-essential.&nbsp; I should fear he might even stigmatise 
imagination as a figment, and delicacy as an affectation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;An honest rough heartiness Mr. Lewes will give you; yet in case 
you have the misfortune to remark that the heartiness might be quite as 
honest if it were less rough, would you not run the risk of being termed a 
sentimentalist or a dreamer?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were I privileged to address Mr. Lewes, and were it wise or 
becoming to say to him exactly what one thinks, I should utter words to 
this effect&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You have a sound, clear judgment as far as it goes, but I 
conceive it to be limited; your standard of talent is high, but I cannot 
acknowledge it to be the highest; you are deserving of all attention when 
you lay down the law on principles, but you are to be resisted when you 
dogmatise on feelings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;To a certain point, Mr. Lewes, you can go, but no 
farther.&nbsp; Be as sceptical as you please on whatever lies beyond a 
certain intellectual limit; the mystery will never be cleared up to you, 
for that limit you will never overpass.&nbsp; Not all your learning, not 
all your reading, not all your sagacity, not all your <!-- page 437--><a 
name="page437"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 437</span>perseverance can help
you over one viewless line&mdash;one boundary as impassable as it is 
invisible.&nbsp; To enter that sphere a man must be born within it; and 
untaught peasants have there drawn their first breath, while learned 
philosophers have striven hard till old age to reach it, and have never 
succeeded.&rdquo;&nbsp; I should not dare, nor would it be right, to say 
this to Mr. Lewes, but I cannot help thinking it both of him and many 
others who have a great name in the world.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hester Mason&rsquo;s character, career, and fate appeared to me 
so strange, grovelling, and miserable, that I never for a moment doubted 
the whole dreary picture was from the life.&nbsp; I thought in describing 
the &ldquo;rustic poetess,&rdquo; in giving the details of her vulgar 
provincial and disreputable metropolitan notoriety, and especially in 
touching on the ghastly catastrophe of her fate, he was faithfully 
recording facts&mdash;thus, however repulsively, yet conscientiously 
&ldquo;pointing a moral,&rdquo; if not &ldquo;adorning a tale&rdquo;; but 
if Hester be the daughter of Lewes&rsquo;s imagination, and if her 
experience and her doom be inventions of his fancy, I wish him better, and 
higher, and truer taste next time he writes a novel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Julius&rsquo;s exploit with the side of bacon is not defensible; 
he might certainly, for the fee of a shilling or sixpence, have got a boy 
to carry it for him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Captain Heath, too, must have cut a deplorable figure behind the 
post-chaise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Vyner strikes one as a portrait from the life; and it 
equally strikes one that the artist hated his original model with a 
personal hatred.&nbsp; She is made so bad that one cannot in the least 
degree sympathise with any of those who love her; one can only despise 
them.&nbsp; She is a fiend, and therefore not like Mr. Thackeray&rsquo;s 
Rebecca, where neither vanity, heartlessness, nor falsehood have been 
spared by the vigorous and skilful hand which portrays them, but where the 
human being has been preserved nevertheless, and where, consequently, the 
lesson given is infinitely more impressive.&nbsp; We can learn little from 
the strange fantasies of demons&mdash;we are not of their kind; but the 
vices of the deceitful, selfish man or woman humble and <!-- page 438--><a 
name="page438"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 438</span>warn us.&nbsp; In 
your remarks on the good girls I concur to the letter; and I must add that 
I think Blanche, amiable as she is represented, could never have loved her 
husband after she had discovered that he was utterly despicable.&nbsp; Love
is stronger than Cruelty, stronger than Death, but perishes under Meanness;
Pity may take its place, but Pity is not Love.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So far, then, I not only agree with you, but I marvel at the nice
perception with which you have discriminated, and at the accuracy with 
which you have marked each coarse, cold, improbable, unseemly defect.&nbsp;
But now I am going to take another side: I am going to differ from you, and
it is about Cecil Chamberlayne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You say that no man who had intellect enough to paint a picture, 
or write a comic opera, could act as he did; you say that men of genius and
talent may have egregious faults, but they cannot descend to brutality or 
meanness.&nbsp; Would that the case were so!&nbsp; Would that intellect 
could preserve from low vice!&nbsp; But, alas! it cannot.&nbsp; No, the 
whole character of Cecil is painted with but too faithful a hand; it is 
very masterly, because it is very true.&nbsp; Lewes is nobly right when he 
says that intellect is <i>not</i> the highest faculty of man, though it may
be the most brilliant; when he declares that the <i>moral</i> nature of his
kind is more sacred than the <i>intellectual</i> nature; when he prefers 
&ldquo;goodness, lovingness, and quiet self-sacrifice to all the talents in
the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is something divine in the thought that genius preserves 
from degradation, were it but true; but Savage tells us it was not true for
him; Sheridan confirms the avowal, and Byron seals it with terrible 
proof.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You never probably knew a Cecil Chamberlayne.&nbsp; If you had 
known such a one you would feel that Lewes has rather subdued the picture 
than overcharged it; you would know that mental gifts without moral 
firmness, without a clear sense of right and wrong, without the honourable 
principle which makes a man rather proud than ashamed of honest labour, are
no guarantee from even deepest baseness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have received the <i>Dublin University Magazine</i>.&nbsp; The 
notice <!-- page 439--><a name="page439"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
439</span>is more favourable than I had anticipated; indeed, I had for a 
long time ceased to anticipate any from that quarter; but the critic does 
not strike one as too bright.&nbsp; Poor Mr. James is severely handled; 
<i>you</i>, likewise, are hard upon him.&nbsp; He always strikes me as a 
miracle of productiveness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must conclude by thanking you for your last letter, which both 
pleased and instructed me.&nbsp; You are quite right in thinking it 
exhibits the writer&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; Yes, it exhibits it 
<i>unmistakeably</i> (as Lewes would say).&nbsp; And whenever it shall be 
my lot to submit another MS. to your inspection, I shall crave the full 
benefit of certain points in that character: I shall ever entreat my 
<i>first critic</i> to be as impartial as he is friendly; what he feels to 
be out of taste in my writings, I hope he will unsparingly condemn.&nbsp; 
In the excitement of composition, one is apt to fall into errors that one 
regrets afterwards, and we never feel our own faults so keenly as when we 
see them exaggerated in others.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I conclude in haste, for I have written too long a letter; but it
is because there was much to answer in yours.&nbsp; It interested me.&nbsp;
I could not help wishing to tell you how nearly I agreed with 
you.&mdash;Believe me, yours sincerely,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>April</i> 5<i>th</i>, 1849.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your note was very 
welcome.&nbsp; I purposely impose on myself the restraint of writing to you
seldom now, because I know but too well my letters cannot be 
cheering.&nbsp; Yet I confess I am glad when the post brings me a letter: 
it reminds me that if the sun of action and life does not shine on us, it 
yet beams full on other parts of the world&mdash;and I like the 
recollection.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not going to complain.&nbsp; Anne has indeed suffered much 
at intervals since I last wrote to you&mdash;frost and east wind have had 
their effect.&nbsp; She has passed nights of sleeplessness and pain, and 
days of depression and languor which nothing could cheer&mdash;but still, 
with the return of genial weather she revives.&nbsp; I cannot perceive that
she is feebler <!-- page 440--><a name="page440"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 440</span>now than she was a month ago, though that is 
not saying much.&nbsp; It proves, however, that no rapid process of 
destruction is going on in her frame, and keeps alive a hope that with the 
renovating aid of summer she may yet be spared a long time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What you tell me of Mr. Lewes seems to me highly 
characteristic.&nbsp; How sanguine, versatile, and self-confident must that
man be who can with ease exchange the quiet sphere of the author for the 
bustling one of the actor!&nbsp; I heartily wish him success; and, in 
happier times, there are few things I should have relished more than an 
opportunity of seeing him in his new character.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Cornhill books are still our welcome and congenial resource 
when Anne is well enough to enjoy reading.&nbsp; Carlyle&rsquo;s 
<i>Miscellanies</i> interest me greatly.&nbsp; We have read <i>The Emigrant
Family</i>.&nbsp; The characters in the work are good, full of quiet truth 
and nature, and the local colouring is excellent; yet I can hardly call it 
a good novel.&nbsp; Reflective, truth-loving, and even elevated as is 
Alexander Harris&rsquo;s mind, I should say he scarcely possesses the 
creative faculty in sufficient vigour to excel as a writer of 
fiction.&nbsp; He <i>creates</i> nothing&mdash;he only copies.&nbsp; His 
characters are portraits&mdash;servilely accurate; whatever is at all ideal
is not original.&nbsp; <i>The Testimony to the Truth</i> is a better book 
than any tale he can write will ever be.&nbsp; Am I too dogmatical in 
saying this?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anne thanks you sincerely for the kind interest you take in her 
welfare, and both she and I beg to express our sense of Mrs. 
Williams&rsquo;s good wishes, which you mentioned in a former letter.&nbsp;
We are grateful, too, to Mr. Smith and to all who offer us the sympathy of 
friendship.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whenever you can write with pleasure to yourself, remember Currer
Bell is glad to hear from you, and he will make his letters as little 
dreary as he can in reply.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>It was always a great trouble to Miss Wheelwright, whose friendship, it 
will be remembered, she had made in Brussels, that Charlotte was 
monopolised by the Smiths on her <!-- page 441--><a

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear L&aelig;titia</span>,&mdash;I have 
just time to save the post by writing a brief note.&nbsp; I reached home 
safely on Saturday afternoon, and, I am thankful to say, found papa quite 
well.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The evening after I left you passed better than I expected.&nbsp;
Thanks to my substantial lunch and cheering cup of coffee, I was able to 
wait the eight o&rsquo;clock dinner with complete resignation, and to 
endure its length quite courageously, nor was I too much exhausted to 
converse; and of this I was glad, for otherwise I know my kind host and 
hostess would have been much disappointed.&nbsp; There were only seven 
gentlemen at dinner besides Mr. Smith, but of these, five were 
critics&mdash;a formidable band, including the literary Rhadamanthi of the 
<i>Times</i>, the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>, the <i>Examiner</i>, the 
<i>Spectator</i>, and the <i>Atlas</i>: men more dreaded in the world of 
letters than you can conceive.&nbsp; I did not know how much their presence
and conversation had excited me till they were gone, and then reaction 
commenced.&nbsp; When I had retired for the night I wished to sleep; the 
effort to do so was vain&mdash;I could not close my eyes.&nbsp; Night 
passed, morning came, and I rose without having known a moment&rsquo;s 
slumber.&nbsp; So utterly worn out was I when I got to Derby, that I was 
obliged to stay there all night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The post is going.&nbsp; Give my affectionate love to your mamma,
Emily, Fanny, and Sarah Anne.&nbsp; Remember me respectfully to your papa, 
and&mdash;Believe me, dear L&aelig;titia, yours faithfully,</p>

<p>Miss Wheelwright&rsquo;s other sisters well remember certain episodes in
connection with these London visits.&nbsp; They recall Charlotte&rsquo;s 
anxiety and trepidation at the prospect of meeting Thackeray.&nbsp; They 
recollect her simple, dainty dress, her shy demeanour, her absolutely 
unspoiled character.&nbsp; They tell me it was in the <i>Illustrated London
News</i>, about <!-- page 442--><a name="page442"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 442</span>the time of the publication of <i>Shirley</i>,
that they first learnt that Currer Bell and Charlotte Bront&euml; were 
one.&nbsp; They would, however, have known that <i>Shirley</i> was by a 
Brussels pupil, they declared, from the absolute resemblance of Hortense 
Moore to one of their governesses&mdash;Mlle. Hausse.</p>
<p>At the end of 1849 Miss Bront&euml; and Miss Martineau became 
acquainted.&nbsp; Charlotte&rsquo;s admiration for her more strong-minded 
sister writer was at first profound.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO JAMES TAYLOR</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>January</i> 1<i>st</i>, 1850.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am sorry there 
should have occurred an irregularity in the transmission of the papers; it 
has been owing to my absence from home.&nbsp; I trust the interruption has 
occasioned no inconvenience.&nbsp; Your last letter evinced such a sincere 
and discriminating admiration for Dr. Arnold, that perhaps you will not be 
wholly uninterested in hearing that during my late visit to Miss Martineau 
I saw much more of Fox How and its inmates, and daily admired, in the widow
and children of one of the greatest and best men of his time, the 
possession of qualities the most estimable and endearing.&nbsp; Of my kind 
hostess herself I cannot speak in terms too high.&nbsp; Without being able 
to share all her opinions, philosophical, political, or religious, without 
adopting her theories, I yet find a worth and greatness in herself, and a 
consistency, benevolence, perseverance in her practice such as wins the 
sincerest esteem and affection.&nbsp; She is not a person to be judged by 
her writings alone, but rather by her own deeds and life&mdash;than which 
nothing can be more exemplary or nobler.&nbsp; She seems to me the 
benefactress of Ambleside, yet takes no sort of credit to herself for her 
active and indefatigable philanthropy.&nbsp; The government of her 
household is admirably administered; all she does is well done, from the 
writing of a history down to the quietest female occupation.&nbsp; No sort 
of carelessness or neglect is allowed under her rule, and yet she is not 
over strict nor too rigidly exacting; her servants and her poor neighbours 
love as well as respect her.</p>
<p><!-- page 443--><a name="page443"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
443</span>&lsquo;I must not, however, fall into the error of talking too 
much about her, merely because my own mind is just now deeply impressed 
with what I have seen of her intellectual power and moral worth.&nbsp; 
Faults she has, but to me they appear very trivial weighed in the balance 
against her excellencies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the excitement which <i>Shirley</i> was exciting in Currer 
Bell&rsquo;s home circle was not confined to the curates.&nbsp; Here is a 
letter which Canon Heald (Cyril Hall) wrote at this time:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Birstall</span>, 
near <span class="smcap">Leeds</span>,<br />
&lsquo;8<i>th</i> <i>January</i> 1850.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;Fame says you are on
a visit with the renowned Currer Bell, the &ldquo;great unknown&rdquo; of 
the present day.&nbsp; The celebrated <i>Shirley</i> has just found its way
hither.&nbsp; And as one always reads a book with more interest when one 
has a correct insight into the writer&rsquo;s designs, I write to ask a 
favour, which I ought not to be regarded presumptuous in saying that I 
think I have a species of claim to ask, on the ground of a sort of 
&ldquo;poetical justice.&rdquo;&nbsp; The interpretation of this enigma is,
that the story goes that either I or my father, I do not exactly know 
which, are part of &ldquo;Currer Bell&rsquo;s&rdquo; stock-in-trade, under 
the title of Mr. Hall, in that Mr. Hall is represented as black, bilious, 
and of dismal aspect, stooping a trifle, and indulging a little now and 
then in the indigenous dialect.&nbsp; This seems to sit very well on your 
humble servant&mdash;other traits do better for my good father than 
myself.&nbsp; However, though I had no idea that I should be made a means 
to amuse the public, Currer Bell is perfectly welcome to what she can make 
of so unpromising a subject.&nbsp; But I think <i>I have a fair claim in 
return to be let into the secret of the company I have got into</i>.&nbsp; 
Some of them are good enough to tell, and need no &OElig;dipus to solve the
riddle.&nbsp; I can tabulate, for instance, the Yorke family for the 
Taylors, Mr. Moore&mdash;Mr. Cartwright, and Mr. Helstone is <!-- page 
444--><a name="page444"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 444</span>clearly 
meant for Mr. Robertson, though the authoress has evidently got her idea of
his character through an unfavourable medium, and does not understand the 
full value of one of the most admirable characters I ever knew or expect to
know.&nbsp; May thinks she descries Cecilia Crowther and Miss Johnston 
(afterwards Mrs. Westerman) in two old maids.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now pray get us a full light on all other names and localities 
that are adumbrated in this said <i>Shirley</i>.&nbsp; When some of the 
prominent characters will be recognised by every one who knows our 
quarters, there can be no harm in letting one know who may be intended by 
the rest.&nbsp; And, if necessary, I will bear Currer Bell harmless, and 
not let the world know that I have my intelligence from 
head-quarters.&nbsp; As I said before, I repeat now, that as I or mine are 
part of the stock-in-trade, I think I have an equitable claim to this 
intelligence, by way of my dividend.&nbsp; Mary and Harriet wish also to 
get at this information; and the latter at all events seems to have her own
peculiar claim, as fame says she is &ldquo;in the book&rdquo; too.&nbsp; 
One had need &ldquo;walk . . . warily in these dangerous days,&rdquo; when,
as Burns (is it not he?) says&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lsquo;A chield&rsquo;s among you taking notes,<br

<p>&lsquo;Mary and Harriet unite with me in the best wishes of the season

<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>February</i> 2<i>nd</i>, 1850.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have despatched 
to-day a parcel containing <i>The Caxtons</i>, Macaulay&rsquo;s 
<i>Essays</i>, <i>Humboldt&rsquo;s Letters</i>, and such other of the books
as I have read, packed with a picturesque irregularity well calculated to 
excite the envy and admiration of your skilful functionary in 
Cornhill.&nbsp; <!-- page 445--><a name="page445"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 445</span>By-the-bye, he ought to be careful of the few 
pins stuck in here and there, as he might find them useful at a future day,
in case of having more bonnets to pack for the East Indies.&nbsp; Whenever 
you send me a new supply of books, may I request that you will have the 
goodness to include one or two of Miss Austen&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I am often 
asked whether I have read them, and I excite amazement by replying in the 
negative.&nbsp; I have read none except <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>.&nbsp; 
Miss Martineau mentioned <i>Persuasion</i> as the best.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you for your account of the <i>First Performance</i>.&nbsp;
It was cheering and pleasant to read it, for in your animated description I
seemed to realise the scene; your criticism also enables me to form some 
idea of the play.&nbsp; Lewes is a strange being.&nbsp; I always regret 
that I did not see him when in London.&nbsp; He seems to me clever, sharp, 
and coarse; I used to think him sagacious, but I believe now he is no more 
than shrewd, for I have observed once or twice that he brings forward as 
grand discoveries of his own, information he has casually received from 
others&mdash;true sagacity disdains little tricks of this sort.&nbsp; But 
though Lewes has many smart and some deserving points about him, he has 
nothing truly great; and nothing truly great, I should think, will he ever 
produce.&nbsp; Yet he merits just such successes as the one you 
describe&mdash;triumphs public, brief, and noisy.&nbsp; Notoriety suits 
Lewes.&nbsp; Fame&mdash;were it possible that he could achieve 
her&mdash;would be a thing uncongenial to him: he could not wait for the 
solemn blast of her trumpet, sounding long, and slowly waxing louder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I always like your way of mentioning Mr. Smith, because my own 
opinion of him concurs with yours; and it is as pleasant to have a 
favourable impression of character confirmed, as it is painful to see it 
dispelled.&nbsp; I am sure he possesses a fine nature, and I trust the 
selfishness of the world and the hard habits of business, though they may 
and must modify him disposition, will never quite spoil it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can you give me any information respecting Sheridan 
Knowles?&nbsp; A few lines received from him lately, and a present of his 
<i>George Lovel</i>, induce me to ask the question.&nbsp; Of course <!-- 
page 446--><a name="page446"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 446</span>I am 
aware that he is a dramatic writer of eminence, but do you know anything 
about him as a man?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe both <i>Shirley</i> and <i>Jane Eyre</i> are being a 
good deal read in the North just now; but I only hear fitful rumours from 
time to time.&nbsp; I ask nothing, and my life of anchorite seclusion shuts
out all bearers of tidings.&nbsp; One or two curiosity-hunter have made 
their way to Haworth Parsonage, but our rude hill and rugged neighbourhood 
will, I doubt not, form a sufficient barrier to the frequent repetition of 
such visits.&mdash;Believe me, yours sincerely,</p>

<p>The most permanent friend among the curiosity-hunters, was Sir James 
Kay-Shuttleworth, <a name="citation446"></a><a href="#footnote446" 
class="citation">[446]</a> who came a month later to Haworth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>March</i> 1<i>st</i>, 1850.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I scribble you a 
line in haste to tell you of my proceedings.&nbsp; Various folks are 
beginning to come boring to Haworth, on the wise errand of seeing the 
scenery described in <i>Jane Eyre</i> and <i>Shirley</i>; amongst others, 
Sir J. K. Shuttleworth and Lady S. have persisted in coming; they were here
on Friday.&nbsp; The baronet looks in vigorous health; he scarcely appears 
more than thirty-five, but he says he is forty-four.&nbsp; Lady 
Shuttleworth is rather handsome, and still young.&nbsp; They were both 
quite unpretending.&nbsp; When here they again urged me to visit 
them.&nbsp; Papa took their side at once&mdash;would not hear of my 
refusing.&nbsp; I must go&mdash;this left me without plea or defence.&nbsp;
I consented to go for three days.&nbsp; They wanted me to return with them 
in the carriage, but I pleaded off till to-morrow.&nbsp; I wish it was well
over.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If all be well I shall be able to write more about them when <!--
page 447--><a name="page447"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 447</span>I come 
back.&nbsp; Sir J. is very courtly&mdash;fine-looking; I wish he may be as 
sincere as he is polished.&mdash;In haste, yours faithfully,</p>

<p style="text-align: center">TO W. S. WILLIAMS</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>March</i> 16<i>th</i>, 1850.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I found your letter
with several others awaiting me on my return home from a brief stay in 
Lancashire.&nbsp; The mourning border alarmed me much.&nbsp; I feared that 
dread visitant, before whose coming every household trembles, had invaded 
your hearth and taken from you perhaps a child, perhaps something dearer 
still.&nbsp; The loss you have actually sustained is painful, but so much 
<i>less</i> painful than what I had anticipated, that to read your letter 
was to be greatly relieved.&nbsp; Still, I know what Mrs. Williams will 
feel.&nbsp; We can have but one father, but one mother, and when either is 
gone, we have lost what can never be replaced.&nbsp; Offer her, under this 
affliction, my sincere sympathy.&nbsp; I can well imagine the cloud these 
sad tidings would cast over your young cheerful family.&nbsp; Poor little 
Dick&rsquo;s exclamation and burst of grief are most na&iuml;ve and 
natural; he felt the sorrow of a child&mdash;a keen, but, happily, a 
transient pang.&nbsp; Time will, I trust, ere long restore your own and 
your wife&rsquo;s serenity and your children&rsquo;s cheerfulness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mentioned, I think, that we had one or two visitors at Haworth 
lately; amongst them were Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth and his lady.&nbsp; 
Before departing they exacted a promise that I would visit them at 
Gawthorpe Hall, their residence on the borders of East Lancashire.&nbsp; I 
went reluctantly, for it is always a difficult and painful thing to me to 
meet the advances of people whose kindness I am in no position to 
repay.&nbsp; Sir James is a man of polished manners, with clear intellect 
and highly cultivated mind.&nbsp; On the whole, I got on very well with 
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His health is just now somewhat broken by his severe official 
labours; and the quiet drives to old ruins and old halls situate amongst 
older hills and woods, the dialogues (perhaps I should rather say 
monologues, for I listened far more than I talked) by the fireside in his 
antique oak-panelled drawing-room, while <!-- page 448--><a 
name="page448"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 448</span>they suited him, did 
not too much oppress and exhaust me.&nbsp; The house, too, is very much to 
my taste, near three centuries old, grey, stately, and picturesque.&nbsp; 
On the whole, now that the visit is over, I do not regret having paid 
it.&nbsp; The worst of it is that there is now some menace hanging over my 
head of an invitation to go to them in London during the season&mdash;this,
which would doubtless be a great enjoyment to some people, is a perfect 
terror to me.&nbsp; I should highly prize the advantages to be gained in an
extended range of observation, but I tremble at the thought of the price I 
must necessarily pay in mental distress and physical wear and tear.&nbsp; 
But you shall have no more of my confessions&mdash;to you they will appear 
folly.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. 
Bront&euml;</span>.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>March</i> 19<i>th</i>, 1850.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I have got home 
again, and now that the visit is over, I am, as usual, glad I have been; 
not that I could have endured to prolong it: a few days at once, in an 
utterly strange place, amongst utterly strange faces, is quite enough for 
me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When the train stopped at Burnley, I found Sir James waiting for 
me.&nbsp; A drive of about three miles brought us to the gates of 
Gawthorpe, and after passing up a somewhat desolate avenue, there towered 
the hall&mdash;grey, antique, castellated, and stately&mdash;before 
me.&nbsp; It is 250 years old, and, within as without, is a model of old 
English architecture.&nbsp; The arms and the strange crest of the 
Shuttleworths are carved on the oak pannelling of each room.&nbsp; They are
not a parvenue family, but date from the days of Richard III.&nbsp; This 
part of Lancashire seems rather remarkable for its houses of ancient 
race.&nbsp; The Townleys, who live near, go back to the Conquest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The people, however, were of still more interest to me than the 
house.&nbsp; Lady Shuttleworth is a little woman, thirty-two years old, 
with a pretty, smooth, lively face.&nbsp; Of pretension to aristocratic 
airs she may be entirely acquitted; of frankness, good-humour, and activity
she has enough; truth obliges me to add, that, as it seems to me, grace, 
dignity, fine feeling were <!-- page 449--><a name="page449"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 449</span>not in the inventory of her qualities.&nbsp; 
These last are precisely what her husband possesses.&nbsp; In manner he can
be gracious and dignified; his tastes and feelings are capable of 
elevation; frank he is not, but, on the contrary, politic; he calls himself
a man of the world and knows the world&rsquo;s ways; courtly and affable in
some points of view, he is strict and rigorous in others.&nbsp; In him high
mental cultivation is combined with an extended range of observation, and 
thoroughly practical views and habits.&nbsp; His nerves are naturally 
acutely sensitive, and the present very critical state of his health has 
exaggerated sensitiveness into irritability.&nbsp; His wife is of a 
temperament precisely suited to nurse him and wait on him; if her 
sensations were more delicate and acute she would not do half so 
well.&nbsp; They get on perfectly together.&nbsp; The children&mdash;there 
are four of them&mdash;are all fine children in their way.&nbsp; They have 
a young German lady as governess&mdash;a quiet, well-instructed, 
interesting girl, whom I took to at once, and, in my heart, liked better 
than anything else in the house.&nbsp; She also instinctively took to 
me.&nbsp; She is very well treated for a governess, but wore the usual 
pale, despondent look of her class.&nbsp; She told me she was home-sick, 
and she looked so.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have received the parcel containing the cushion and all the 
etcetera, for which I thank you very much.&nbsp; I suppose I must begin 
with the group of flowers; I don&rsquo;t know how I shall manage it, but I 
shall try.&nbsp; I have a good number of letters to answer&mdash;from Mr. 
Smith, from Mr. Williams, from Thornton Hunt, L&aelig;titia Wheelwright, 
Harriet Dyson&mdash;and so I must bid you good-bye for the present.&nbsp; 
Write to me soon.&nbsp; The brief absence from home, though in some 
respects trying and painful in itself, has, I think, given me a little 
better tone of spirit.&nbsp; All through this month of February I have had 
a crushing time of it.&nbsp; I could not escape from or rise above certain 
most mournful recollections&mdash;the last few days, the sufferings, the

seriously ill.&nbsp; Two physicians are in attendance twice a day, and

allow any one else &ldquo;to introduce me&rdquo; as he says, &ldquo;into

I could not help smiling at this sentence.&nbsp; But I shall willingly

another.&nbsp; His sufferings are very great.&nbsp; I trust and hope God

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I came to London 
last Thursday.&nbsp; I am staying at Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s, who has changed 
her residence, as the address will show.&nbsp; A good deal of writing 
backwards and forwards, persuasion, etc., took place before this step was 
resolved on; but at last I explained to Sir James that I had some little 
matters of business to transact, and that I should stay quietly at my 
publisher&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He has called twice, and Lady Shuttleworth once; 
each of them alone.&nbsp; He is in a fearfully nervous state.&nbsp; To my 
great horror he talks of my going with them to Hampton Court, Windsor, 
etc.&nbsp; God knows how I shall get on.&nbsp; I perfectly dread it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here I feel very comfortable.&nbsp; Mrs. Smith treats me with a 
serene, equable kindness which just suits me.&nbsp; Her son is, as before, 
genial and kindly.&nbsp; I have seen very few persons, and <!-- page 
451--><a name="page451"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 451</span>am not 
likely to see many, as the agreement was that I was to be very quiet.&nbsp;
We have been to the Exhibition of the Royal Academy, to the Opera, and the 
Zoological Gardens.&nbsp; The weather is splendid.&nbsp; I shall not stay 
longer than a fortnight in London.&nbsp; The feverishness and exhaustion 
beset me somewhat, but not quite so badly as before, as indeed I have not 
yet been so much tried.&nbsp; I hope you will write soon and tell me how 
you are getting on.&nbsp; Give my regards to all.&mdash;Yours

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Papa</span>,&mdash;I was very glad to 
get your letter this morning, and still more glad to learn that your health
continues in some degree to improve.&nbsp; I fear you will feel the present
weather somewhat debilitating, at least if it is as warm in Yorkshire as in
London.&nbsp; I cannot help grudging these fine days on account of the 
roofing of the house.&nbsp; It is a great pity the workmen were not 
prepared to begin a week ago.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since I wrote I have been to the Opera; to the Exhibition of the 
Royal Academy, where there were some fine paintings, especially a large one
by Landseer of the Duke of Wellington on the field of Waterloo, and a 
grand, wonderful picture of Martin&rsquo;s from Campbell&rsquo;s poem of 
the &ldquo;Last Man,&rdquo; showing the red sun fading out of the sky, and 
all the soil of the foreground made up of bones and skulls.&nbsp; The 
secretary of the Zoological Society also sent me an honorary ticket of 
admission to their gardens, which I wish you could see.&nbsp; There are 
animals from all parts of the world inclosed in great cages in the open air
amongst trees and shrubs&mdash;lions, tigers, leopards, elephants, 
numberless monkies, camels, five or six cameleopards, a young hippopotamus 
with an Egyptian for its keeper; birds of all kinds&mdash;eagles, 
ostriches, a pair of great condors from the Andes, strange ducks and 
water-fowl which seem very happy and comfortable, and build their nests 
amongst the reeds and sedges of the lakes where they are kept.&nbsp; Some 
of the American birds make inexpressible noises.</p>
<p><!-- page 452--><a name="page452"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
452</span>&lsquo;There are also all sorts of living snakes and lizards in 
cages, some great Ceylon toads not much smaller than Flossy, some large 
foreign rats nearly as large and fierce as little bull-dogs.&nbsp; The most
ferocious and deadly-looking things in the place were these rats, a 
laughing hyena (which every now and then uttered a hideous peal of laughter
such as a score of maniacs might produce) and a cobra di capello 
snake.&nbsp; I think this snake was the worst of all: it had the eyes and 
face of a fiend, and darted out its barbed tongue sharply and 
incessantly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad to hear that Tabby and Martha are pretty well.&nbsp;

<p>&lsquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t care for the notice in <i>Sharpe&rsquo;s

is of no consequence whatever in a literary sense.&nbsp; Sharpe, the 
proprietor, was an apprentice of Mr. Smith&rsquo;s father.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I am leaving London,
if all be well, on Tuesday, and shall be very glad to come to you for a few
days, if that arrangement still remains convenient to you.&nbsp; I intend 
to start at nine o&rsquo;clock <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> by the 
express train, which arrives in Leeds thirty-five minutes past two.&nbsp; I
should then be at Batley about four in the afternoon.&nbsp; Would that 
suit?</p>
<p>&lsquo;My London visit has much surpassed my expectations this time; I 
have suffered less and enjoyed more than before.&nbsp; Rather a trying 
termination yet remains to me.&nbsp; Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s youngest son is at 
school in Scotland, and George, her eldest, is going to fetch him home for 
the vacation.&nbsp; The other evening he announced his intention of taking 
one of his sisters with him, and proposed that Miss Bront&euml; should go 
down to Edinburgh and join them there, and see that city and its 
suburbs.&nbsp; I concluded he was joking, laughed and declined; however, it
seems he was in earnest.&nbsp; The thing appearing to me perfectly <!-- 
page 453--><a name="page453"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 453</span>out of 
the question, I still refused.&nbsp; Mrs. Smith did not favour it; you may 
easily fancy how she helped me to sustain my opposition, but her worthy son
only waxed more determined.&nbsp; His mother is master of the house, but he
is master of his mother.&nbsp; This morning she came and entreated me to 
go.&nbsp; &ldquo;George wished it so much&rdquo;; he had begged her to use 
her influence, etc., etc.&nbsp; Now I believe that George and I understand 
each other very well, and respect each other very sincerely.&nbsp; We both 
know the wide breach time has made between us; we do not embarrass each 
other, or very rarely; my six or eight years of seniority, to say nothing 
of lack of all pretension to beauty, etc., are a perfect safeguard.&nbsp; I
should not in the least fear to go with him to China.&nbsp; I like to see 
him pleased, I greatly <i>dis</i>like to ruffle and disappoint him, so he 
shall have his mind; and if all be well, I mean to join him in Edinburgh 
after I shall have spent a few days with you.&nbsp; With his buoyant animal
spirits and youthful vigour he will make severe demands on my muscles and 
nerves, but I daresay I shall get through somehow, and then perhaps come 
back to rest a few days with you before I go home.&nbsp; With kind regards 
to all at Brookroyd, your guests included,&mdash;I am, dear Ellen, yours

<i>July</i> 30<i>th</i>, 1850.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear L&aelig;titia</span>,&mdash;I 
promised to write to you when I should have returned home.&nbsp; Returned 
home I am, but you may conceive that many, many matters solicit attention 
and demand arrangement in a house which has lately been turned topsy-turvy 
in the operation of unroofing.&nbsp; Drawers and cupboards must wait a 
moment, however, while I fulfil my promise, though it is imperatively 
necessary that this fulfilment should be achieved with brevity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My stay in Scotland was short, and what I saw was chiefly 
comprised in Edinburgh and the neighbourhood, in Abbotsford and Melrose, 
for I was obliged to relinquish my first intention <!-- page 454--><a 
name="page454"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 454</span>of going from Glasgow
to Oban and thence through a portion of the Highlands.&nbsp; But though the
time was brief, and the view of objects limited, I found such a charm of 
situation, association, and circumstances that I think the enjoyment 
experienced in that little space equalled in degree and excelled in kind 
all which London yielded during a month&rsquo;s sojourn.&nbsp; Edinburgh 
compared to London is like a vivid page of history compared to a huge dull 
treatise on political economy; and as to Melrose and Abbotsford, the very 
names possess music and magic.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am thankful to say that on my return home I found papa pretty 
well.&nbsp; Full often had I thought of him when I was far away; and deeply
sad as it is on many accounts to come back to this old house, yet I was 
glad to be with him once more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You were proposing, I remember, to go into the country; I trust 
you are there now and enjoying this fine day in some scene where the air 
will not be tainted, nor the sunshine dimmed, by London smoke.&nbsp; If 
your papa, mamma, or any of your sisters are within reach, give them my 
kindest remembrances&mdash;if not, save such remembrances till you see 
them.&mdash;Believe me, my dear L&aelig;titia, yours hurriedly but

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Papa</span>,&mdash;I think I shall not 
come home till Thursday.&nbsp; If all be well I shall leave here on Monday 
and spend a day or two with Ellen Nussey.&nbsp; I have enjoyed my visit 
exceedingly.&nbsp; Sir J. K. Shuttleworth has called several times and 
taken me out in his carriage.&nbsp; He seems very truly friendly; but, I am
sorry to say, he looks pale and very much wasted.&nbsp; I greatly fear he 
will not live very long unless some change for the better soon takes 
place.&nbsp; Lady S. is ill too, and cannot go out.&nbsp; I have seen a 
good deal of Dr. Arnold&rsquo;s family, and like them much.&nbsp; As to 
Miss Martineau, I admire her and wonder at her more than I can say.&nbsp; 
Her powers of labour, of exercise, and social cheerfulness are beyond my 
comprehension.&nbsp; In spite of <!-- page 455--><a 
name="page455"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 455</span>the unceasing 
activity of her colossal intellect she enjoys robust health.&nbsp; She is a
taller, larger, and more strongly made woman than I had imagined from that 
first interview with her.&nbsp; She is very kind to me, though she must 
think I am a very insignificant person compared to herself.&nbsp; She has 
just been into the room to show me a chapter of her history which she is 
now writing, relating to the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s character and his 
proceedings in the Peninsula.&nbsp; She wanted an opinion on it, and I was 
happy to be able to give a very approving one.&nbsp; She seems to 
understand and do him justice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must not direct any more letters here as they will not reach 
me after to-day.&nbsp; Hoping, dear papa, that you are well, and with kind 
regards to Tabby and Martha,&mdash;I am, your affectionate daughter,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have to thank you
for the care and kindness with which you have assisted me throughout in 
correcting these <i>Remains</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whether, when they are published, they will appear to others as 
they do to me, I cannot tell.&nbsp; I hope not.&nbsp; And indeed I suppose 
what to me is bitter pain will only be soft pathos to the general 
public.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Martineau has several times lately asked me to go and see 
her; and though this is a dreary season for travelling northward, I think 
if papa continues pretty well I shall go in a week or two.&nbsp; I feel to 
my deep sorrow, to my humiliation, that it is not in my power to bear the 
canker of constant solitude.&nbsp; I had calculated that when shut out from
every enjoyment, from every stimulus but what could be derived from 
intellectual exertion, my mind would rouse itself perforce.&nbsp; It is not
so.&nbsp; Even intellect, even imagination, will not dispense with the ray 
of domestic cheerfulness, with the gentle spur of family discussion.&nbsp; 
Late in the evenings, and all through the nights, I fall into a condition 
of mind which turns entirely to the past&mdash;to memory; and memory is 
both sad and relentless.&nbsp; This will never do, and <!-- page 456--><a

good.&nbsp; I tell you this that you may check false anticipations.&nbsp;

drink theirs.&mdash;Yours sincerely,</p>

<p>Among Miss Bront&euml;&rsquo;s papers I find the following letter to 
Miss Martineau, written with a not unnatural resentment after the 
publication of a severe critique of <i>Shirley</i>.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Miss Martineau</span>,&mdash;I think

compliance with the wish you express that I should send your letter.&nbsp; 
I inclose it, and have marked with red ink the passage which struck me 
dumb.&nbsp; All the rest is fair, right, worthy of you, but I protest 
against this passage; and were I brought up before the bar of all the 
critics in England, to such a charge I should respond, &ldquo;Not 
guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know what <i>love</i> is as I understand it; and if man or 
woman should be ashamed of feeling such love, then is there nothing right, 
noble, faithful, truthful, unselfish in this earth, as I comprehend 
rectitude, nobleness, fidelity, truth, and disinterestedness.&mdash;Yours

<p>It was during this visit to Ambleside that Charlotte Bront&euml; and 
Matthew Arnold met.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;At seven,&rsquo; writes Mr. Arnold from Fox How (December 21, 
1850), &lsquo;came Miss Martineau and Miss Bront&euml; (Jane Eyre); talked 
to Miss Martineau (who blasphemes frightfully) about the prospects of the 
Church of England, and, wretched man that I am, promised to go and see her 
cow-keeping miracles <a name="citation457a"></a><a href="#footnote457a" 
class="citation">[457a]</a> to-morrow&mdash;I, who hardly know a cow from a
sheep.&nbsp; I talked to Miss Bront&euml; (past thirty and plain, with 
expressive grey eyes, though) of her curates, of French novels, and her 
education in a school at Brussels, and sent the lions roaring to their dens
at half-past nine, and came to talk to you.&rsquo;&nbsp; <a

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO JAMES TAYLOR, CORNHILL,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>January</i> 15<i>th</i>, 1851.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I fancy the 
imperfect way in which my last note was expressed must have led you into an
error, and that you must have applied to Mrs. Arnold the remarks I intended
for Miss Martineau.&nbsp; I remember whilst writing about &ldquo;my 
hostess&rdquo; I was sensible to some obscurity in the term; permit me now 
to explain that it referred to Miss Martineau.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. Arnold is, indeed, as I judge from my own observations no 
less than from the unanimous testimony of all who really know her, a good 
and amiable woman, but the intellectual is not her forte, and she has no 
pretensions to power or completeness of character.&nbsp; The same remark, I
think, applies to her daughters.&nbsp; You admire in them the kindliest 
feeling towards each other and their fellow-creatures, and they offer in 
their home circle a beautiful example of family unity, and of that 
refinement which is sure to spring thence; but when the conversation turns 
on literature or any subject that offers a test for the intellect, you 
usually felt that their opinions were rather imitative than original, 
rather sentimental than sound.&nbsp; Those who have only seen Mrs. Arnold 
once will necessarily, I think, judge of her unfavourably; her manner on 
introduction disappointed me sensibly, as lacking that genuineness and 
simplicity one seemed to have a right to expect in the chosen 
life-companion of Dr. Arnold.&nbsp; On my remarking as much to Mrs. Gaskell
and Sir J. K. Shuttleworth, I was told for my consolation it was a 
&ldquo;conventional manner,&rdquo; but that it vanished on closer 
acquaintance; fortunately this last assurance proved true.&nbsp; It is 
observable that Matthew Arnold, the eldest son, and the author of the 
volume of poems to which you allude, inherits his mother&rsquo;s 
defect.&nbsp; Striking and prepossessing in appearance, his manner 
displeases from its seeming foppery.&nbsp; I own it caused me at first to 
regard him with regretful surprise; the <!-- page 459--><a 
name="page459"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 459</span>shade of Dr. Arnold 
seemed to me to frown on his young representative.&nbsp; I was told, 
however, that &ldquo;Mr. Arnold improved upon acquaintance.&rdquo;&nbsp; So
it was: ere long a real modesty appeared under his assumed conceit, and 
some genuine intellectual aspirations, as well as high educational 
acquirements, displaced superficial affectations.&nbsp; I was given to 
understand that his theological opinions were very vague and unsettled, and
indeed he betrayed as much in the course of conversation.&nbsp; Most 
unfortunate for him, doubtless, has been the untimely loss of his 
father.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My visit to Westmoreland has certainly done me good.&nbsp; 
Physically, I was not ill before I went there, but my mind had undergone 
some painful laceration.&nbsp; In the course of looking over my 
sister&rsquo;s papers, mementos, and memoranda, that would have been 
nothing to others, conveyed for me so keen a sting.&nbsp; Near at hand 
there was no means of lightening or effacing the sad impression by 
refreshing social intercourse; from my father, of course, my sole care was 
to conceal it&mdash;age demanding the same forbearance as infancy in the 
communication of grief.&nbsp; Continuous solitude grew more than I could 
bear, and, to speak truth, I was glad of a change.&nbsp; You will say that 
we ought to have power in ourselves either to bear circumstances or to bend
them.&nbsp; True, we should do our best to this end, but sometimes our best
is unavailing.&nbsp; However, I am better now, and most thankful for the 
respite.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The interest you so kindly express in my sister&rsquo;s works 
touches me home.&nbsp; Thank you for it, especially as I do not believe you
would speak otherwise than sincerely.&nbsp; The only notices that I have 
seen of the new edition of <i>Wuthering Heights</i> were those in the 
<i>Examiner</i>, the <i>Leader</i>, and the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>.&nbsp; 
That in the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i> somehow gave me pleasure: it is quiet but
respectful&mdash;so I thought, at least.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You asked whether Miss Martineau made me a convert to 
mesmerism?&nbsp; Scarcely; yet I heard miracles of its efficacy and could 
hardly discredit the whole of what was told me.&nbsp; I even underwent a 
personal experiment; and though the result was not absolutely clear, it was
inferred that in time I should prove an excellent subject.</p>
<p><!-- page 460--><a name="page460"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
460</span>&lsquo;The question of mesmerism will be discussed with little 
reserve, I believe, in a forthcoming work of Miss Martineau&rsquo;s, and I 
have some painful anticipations of the manner in which other subjects, 
offering less legitimate ground for speculation, will be handled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mention the <i>Leader</i>; what do you think of it?&nbsp; I 
have been asked to contribute; but though I respect the spirit of fairness 
and courtesy in which it is on the whole conducted, its principles on some 
points are such that I have hitherto shrunk from the thought of seeing my 
name in its columns.</p>

<i>January</i> 12<i>th</i>, 1851.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear L&aelig;titia</span>,&mdash;A spare 
moment must and shall be made for you, no matter how many letters I have to
write (and just now there is an influx).&nbsp; In reply to your kind 
inquiries, I have to say that my stay in London and excursion to Scotland 
did me good&mdash;much good at the time; but my health was again somewhat 
sharply tried at the close of autumn, and I lost in some days of 
indisposition the additional flesh and strength I had previously 
gained.&nbsp; This resulted from the painful task of looking over letters 
and papers belonging to my sisters.&nbsp; Many little mementos and 
memoranda conspired to make an impression inexpressibly sad, which solitude
deepened and fostered till I grew ill.&nbsp; A brief trip to Westmoreland 
has, however, I am thankful to say, revived me again, and the circumstance 
of papa being just now in good health and spirits gives me many causes for 
gratitude.&nbsp; When we have but one precious thing left we think much of 
it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been staying a short time with Miss Martineau.&nbsp; As 
you may imagine, the visit proved one of no common interest.&nbsp; She is 
certainly a woman of wonderful endowments, both intellectual and physical, 
and though I share few of her opinions, and regard her as fallible on 
certain points of judgment, I must still accord her my sincerest 
esteem.&nbsp; The manner in which <!-- page 461--><a

highest mental culture with the nicest discharge of feminine duties filled 
me with admiration, while her affectionate kindness earned my 
gratitude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your description of the magician Paxton&rsquo;s crystal palace is
quite graphic.&nbsp; Whether I shall see it or not I don&rsquo;t 
know.&nbsp; London will be so dreadfully crowded and busy this season, I 
feel a dread of going there.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Compelled to break off, I have only time to offer my kindest 
remembrances to your whole circle, and my love to yourself.&mdash;Yours

return to Haworth.&nbsp; Martha will thus have a few days more time, and 
must not hurry or overwork herself.&nbsp; Yesterday I saw Cardinal Wiseman 
and heard him speak.&nbsp; It was at a meeting for the Roman Catholic 
Society of St. Vincent de Paul; the Cardinal presided.&nbsp; He is a big 
portly man something of the shape of Mr. Morgan; he has not merely a double
but a treble and quadruple chin; he has a very large mouth with oily lips, 
and looks as if he would relish a good dinner with a bottle of wine after 
it.&nbsp; He came swimming into the room smiling, simpering, and bowing 
like a fat old lady, and sat down very demure in his chair and looked the 
picture of a sleek hypocrite.&nbsp; He was dressed in black like a bishop 
or dean in plain clothes, but wore scarlet gloves and a brilliant scarlet 
waistcoat.&nbsp; A bevy of inferior priests surrounded him, many of them 
very dark-looking and sinister men.&nbsp; The Cardinal spoke in a smooth 
whining manner, just like a canting Methodist preacher.&nbsp; The audience 
seemed to look up to him as to a god.&nbsp; A spirit of the hottest zeal 
pervaded the whole meeting.&nbsp; I was told afterwards that except myself 
and the person who accompanied me there <!-- page 462--><a 
name="page462"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 462</span>was not a single 
Protestant present.&nbsp; All the speeches turned on the necessity of 
straining every nerve to make converts to popery.&nbsp; It is in such a 
scene that one feels what the Catholics are doing.&nbsp; Most persevering 
and enthusiastic are they in their work!&nbsp; Let Protestants look to 
it.&nbsp; It cheered me much to hear that you continue pretty well.&nbsp;

has found out that I am here.&nbsp; I have some trouble in warding off his

but Mrs. Smith helped me, and I got off with promising to spend a

and most scrupulously attentive.&nbsp; They desire their regards to you, 
and send all manner of civil messages.&nbsp; The Marquis of Westminster and
the Earl of Ellesmere each sent me an order to see their private collection
of pictures, which I enjoyed very much.&nbsp; Mr. Rogers, the 
patriarch-poet, now eighty-seven years old, invited me to breakfast with 
him.&nbsp; His breakfasts, you must understand, are celebrated throughout 
Europe for their peculiar refinement and taste.&nbsp; He never admits at 
that meal more than four persons to his table: himself and three 
guests.&nbsp; The morning I was there I met Lord Glenelg and Mrs. 
Davenport, a relation of Lady Shuttleworth&rsquo;s, and a very beautiful 
and fashionable woman.&nbsp; The visit was very interesting; I was glad 
that I had paid it after it was over.&nbsp; An attention that pleased and 
surprised me more I think than any other was the circumstance of Sir David 
Brewster, who is one of the first scientific men of his day, coming to take
me over the Crystal Palace and pointing out and explaining the most 
remarkable curiosities.&nbsp; You will know, dear papa, that I do not 
mention those things to boast of them, but merely because I think they will
give you pleasure.&nbsp; Nobody, I find, thinks the worse of me for 
avoiding publicity and declining to go to large parties, and everybody 
seems truly courteous and respectful, a mode of behaviour which makes me 
grateful, as it ought to do.&nbsp; Good-bye till Monday.&nbsp; Give my best

464</span>CHAPTER XVII: THE REV. ARTHUR BELL NICHOLLS</h2>
<p>Without the kindly assistance of Mr. Arthur Bell Nicholls, this book 
could not have been written, and I might therefore be supposed to guide my 
pen with appalling discretion in treating of the married life of Charlotte 
Bront&euml;.&nbsp; There are, however, no painful secrets to reveal, no 
skeletons to lay bare.&nbsp; Mr. Nicholls&rsquo;s story is a very simple 
one; and that it is entirely creditable to him, there is abundant 
evidence.&nbsp; Amid the full discussion to which the lives of the 
Bront&euml;s have necessarily been subjected through their ever-continuous 
fame, it was perhaps inevitable that a contrary opinion should gain 
ground.&nbsp; Many of Mr. Nicholls&rsquo;s relatives in his own country 
have frequently sighed over the perverted statements which have obtained 
currency.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is cruel that your uncle Arthur, the best of men,
as we know, should be thus treated,&rsquo; was the comment of Mr. 
Nicholls&rsquo;s brother to his daughter after reading an unfriendly 
article concerning Charlotte&rsquo;s husband.&nbsp; Yet it was not 
unnatural that such an estimate should get abroad; and I may frankly admit 
that until I met Mr. Nicholls I believed that Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s
marriage had been an unhappy one&mdash;an opinion gathered partly from Mrs.
Gaskell, partly from current tradition in Yorkshire.&nbsp; Mrs. Gaskell, in
fact, did not like Mr. Nicholls, and there were those with whom she came in
contact while writing Miss Bront&euml;&rsquo;s Life who were eager to fan 
that feeling in the usually kindly biographer.&nbsp; Mr. <!-- page 465--><a
name="page465"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 465</span>Nicholls himself did 
not work in the direction of conciliation.&nbsp; He was, as we shall see, a
Scotchman, and Scottish taciturnity brought to bear upon the genial and 
jovial Yorkshire folk did not make for friendliness.&nbsp; Further, he 
would not let Mrs. Gaskell &lsquo;edit&rsquo; and change <i>The 
Professor</i>, and here also he did wisely and well.&nbsp; He hated 
publicity, and above all things viewed the attempt to pierce the veil of 
his married life with almost morbid detestation.&nbsp; Who shall say that 
he was not right, and that his retirement for more than forty years from 
the whole region of controversy has not abundantly justified itself?&nbsp; 
One at least of Miss Bront&euml;&rsquo;s friends has been known in our day 
to complain bitterly of all the trouble to which she has been subjected by 
the ill-considered zeal of Bront&euml; enthusiasts.&nbsp; Mr. Nicholls has 
escaped all this by a judicious silence.&nbsp; Now that forty years and 
more have passed since his wife&rsquo;s death, it cannot be inopportune to 
tell the public all that they can fairly ask to know.</p>
<p>Mr. Nicholls was born in Co. Antrim in 1817, but of Scottish parents on 
both sides.&nbsp; He was left at the age of seven to the charge of an 
uncle&mdash;the Rev. Alan Bell&mdash;who was headmaster of the Royal School
at Banagher, in King&rsquo;s Co.&nbsp; Mr. Nicholls afterwards entered 
Trinity College, Dublin, and it was thence that he went to Haworth, his 
first curacy.&nbsp; He succeeded a fellow countryman, Mr. Peter Augustus 
Smith, in 1844.&nbsp; The first impression we have of the new curate in 
Charlotte&rsquo;s letters is scarcely more favourable than that of his 
predecessors.</p>

papa&rsquo;s curate?&nbsp; I scarcely need say that never was rumour more 
unfounded.&nbsp; A cold faraway sort of civility are the only terms on 
which I have ever been with Mr. Nicholls.&nbsp; I could by no means think 
of mentioning such a rumour to him even as a joke.&nbsp; It would make me 
the laughing-stock of himself and his fellow curates for half a year to 
come.&nbsp; They regard me as an old maid, and I regard them, one and all, 
as highly uninteresting, narrow, and unattractive specimens of the coarser 
sex.</p>

moreover, you may possibly think it is my turn, and not yours, though on 
that point I am far from clear, I shall just send you one of my scrubby 
notes for the express purpose of eliciting a reply.&nbsp; Anne was very 
much pleased with your letter; I presume she has answered it before

induce her to converse.&nbsp; I look forward to next summer with the 
confident intention that she shall, if possible, make at least a brief 
sojourn at the sea-side.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am sorry I inoculated you with fears about the east wind; I did
not feel the last blast so severely as I have often done.&nbsp; My 
sympathies were much awakened by the touching anecdote.&nbsp; Did you 
salute your boy-messenger with a box on the ear the next time he came 
across you?&nbsp; I think I should have been strongly tempted to have done 
as much.&nbsp; Mr. Nicholls is not yet returned.&nbsp; I am sorry to say 
that many of the parishioners express a desire that he should not trouble 
himself to recross the Channel.&nbsp; This is not the feeling that ought to
exist between shepherd and flock.&nbsp; It is not such as is prevalent at 
Birstall.&nbsp; It is not such as poor Mr. Weightman excited.</p>

<p>I print the next letter here because, although it contains no reference

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>April</i> 12<i>th</i>, 1852.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear L&aelig;titia</span>,&mdash;Your last 
letter gave me much concern.&nbsp; I had hoped you were long ere this 
restored to your usual health, and it both pained and surprised me to hear 
that you still suffer so much from debility.&nbsp; I cannot help thinking 
your constitution is naturally sound and healthy.&nbsp; Can it be the air 
of London which disagrees with you?&nbsp; For myself, I struggled through 
the winter and the early part of spring often with great difficulty.&nbsp; 
My friend stayed with me a few days in the early part of January&mdash;she 
could not be spared longer.&nbsp; I was <!-- page 470--><a 
name="page470"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 470</span>better during her 
visit, but had a relapse soon after she left me, which reduced my strength 
very much.&nbsp; It cannot be denied that the solitude of my position 
fearfully aggravated its other evils.&nbsp; Some long, stormy days and 
nights there were when I felt such a craving for support and companionship 
as I cannot express.&nbsp; Sleepless, I lay awake night after night; weak 
and unable to occupy myself, I sat in my chair day after day, the saddest 
memories my only company.&nbsp; It was a time I shall never forget, but God
sent it and it must have been for the best.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am better now, and very grateful do I feel for the restoration 
of tolerable health; but, as if there was always to be some affliction, 
papa, who enjoyed wonderful health during the whole winter, is ailing with 
his spring attack of bronchitis.&nbsp; I earnestly trust it may pass over 
in the comparatively ameliorated form in which it has hitherto shown 
itself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me not forget to answer your question about the 
cataract.&nbsp; Tell your papa my father was seventy at the time he 
underwent an operation; he was most reluctant to try the 
experiment&mdash;could not believe that at his age and with his want of 
robust strength it would succeed.&nbsp; I was obliged to be very decided in
the matter and to act entirely on my own responsibility.&nbsp; Nearly six 
years have now elapsed since the cataract was extracted (it was not merely 
depressed).&nbsp; He has never once, during that time, regretted the step, 
and a day seldom passes that he does not express gratitude and pleasure at 
the restoration of that inestimable privilege of vision whose loss he once 
knew.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope the next tidings you hear of your brother Charles will be 
satisfactory for his parents&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; sake as well as his 
own.&nbsp; Your poor mamma has had many successive trials, and her 
uncomplaining resignation seems to offer us all an example worthy to be 
followed.&nbsp; Remember me kindly to her, to your papa, and all your 
circle, and&mdash;Believe me, with best wishes to yourself, yours

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Papa</span>,&mdash;Thank you for your 
letter, which I was so glad to get that I think I must answer it by return 
of post.&nbsp; I had expected one yesterday, and was perhaps a little 
unreasonably anxious when disappointed, but the weather has been so very 
cold that I feared either you were ill or Martha worse.&nbsp; I hope Martha
will take care of herself.&nbsp; I cannot help feeling a little uneasy 
about her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On the whole I get on very well here, but I have not bathed yet 
as I am told it is much too cold and too early in the season.&nbsp; The sea
is very grand.&nbsp; Yesterday it was a somewhat unusually high tide, and I
stood about an hour on the cliffs yesterday afternoon watching the tumbling
in of great tawny turbid waves, that made the whole shore white with foam 
and filled the air with a sound hollower and deeper than thunder.&nbsp; 
There are so very few visitors at Filey yet that I and a few sea-birds and 
fishing-boats have often the whole expanse of sea, shore, and cliff to 
ourselves.&nbsp; When the tide is out the sands are wide, long, and smooth,
and very pleasant to walk on.&nbsp; When the high tides are in, not a 
vestige of sand remains.&nbsp; I saw a great dog rush into the sea 
yesterday, and swim and bear up against the waves like a seal.&nbsp; I 
wonder what Flossy would say to that.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On Sunday afternoon I went to a church which I should like Mr. 
Nicholls to see.&nbsp; It was certainly not more than thrice the length and
breadth of our passage, floored with brick, the walls green with mould, the
pews painted white, but the paint almost all worn off with time and 
decay.&nbsp; At one end there is a little gallery for the singers, and when
these personages stood up to perform they all turned their backs upon the 
congregation, and the congregation turned <i>their</i> backs on the pulpit 
and parson.&nbsp; The effect of this man&oelig;uvre was so ludicrous, I 
could hardly help laughing; had Mr. Nicholls been there he certainly would 
have laughed out.&nbsp; Looking up at the gallery and seeing only the broad
backs of the singers presented to their audience was <!-- page 472--><a 
name="page472"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 472</span>excessively 
grotesque.&nbsp; There is a well-meaning but utterly inactive clergyman at 
Filey, and Methodists flourish.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot help enjoying Mr. Butterfield&rsquo;s defeat; and yet in
one sense this is a bad state of things, calculated to make working people 
both discontented and insubordinate.&nbsp; Give my kind regards, dear papa,
to Mr. Nicholls, Tabby, and Martha.&nbsp; Charge Martha to beware of 
draughts, and to get such help in her cleaning as she shall need.&nbsp; I

conjunction with the incident immediately preceding it, and with a long 
series of indications whose meaning I scarce ventured hitherto to interpret
to myself, much less hint to any other, has left on my mind a feeling of 
deep concern.&nbsp; This note you will see is from Mr. Nicholls.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know not whether you have ever observed him specially when 
staying here.&nbsp; Your perception is generally quick 
enough&mdash;<i>too</i> quick, I have sometimes thought; yet as you never 
said anything, I restrained my own dim misgivings, which could not claim 
the sure guide of vision.&nbsp; What papa has seen or guessed I will not 
inquire, though I may conjecture.&nbsp; He has minutely noticed all Mr. 
Nicholls&rsquo;s low spirits, all his threats of expatriation, all his 
symptoms of impaired health&mdash;noticed them with little sympathy and 
much indirect sarcasm.&nbsp; On Monday evening Mr. Nicholls was here to 
tea.&nbsp; I vaguely felt without clearly seeing, as without seeing I have 
felt for some time, the meaning of his constant looks, and strange, 
feverish restraint.&nbsp; After tea I withdrew to the dining-room as 
usual.&nbsp; As usual, Mr. Nicholls sat with papa till between eight and 
nine o&rsquo;clock; I then heard him open the parlour door as if 
going.&nbsp; I expected the clash of the front door.&nbsp; He stopped in 
the passage; he <!-- page 473--><a name="page473"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 473</span>tapped; like lightning it flashed on me what 
was coming.&nbsp; He entered; he stood before me.&nbsp; What his words were
you can guess; his manner you can hardly realise, nor can I forget 
it.&nbsp; Shaking from head to foot, looking deadly pale, speaking low, 
vehemently, yet with difficulty, he made me for the first time feel what it
costs a man to declare affection where he doubts response.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The spectacle of one ordinarily so statue-like thus trembling, 
stirred, and overcome, gave me a kind of strange shock.&nbsp; He spoke of 
sufferings he had borne for months, of sufferings he could endure no 
longer, and craved leave for some hope.&nbsp; I could only entreat him to 
leave me then and promise a reply on the morrow.&nbsp; I asked him if he 
had spoken to papa.&nbsp; He said he dared not.&nbsp; I think I half led, 
half put him out of the room.&nbsp; When he was gone I immediately went to 
papa, and told him what had taken place.&nbsp; Agitation and anger 
disproportionate to the occasion ensued; if I had <i>loved</i> Mr. 
Nicholls, and had heard such epithets applied to him as were used, it would
have transported me past my patience; as it was, my blood boiled with a 
sense of injustice.&nbsp; But papa worked himself into a state not to be 
trifled with: the veins on his temples started up like whip-cord, and his 
eyes became suddenly bloodshot.&nbsp; I made haste to promise that Mr. 
Nicholls should on the morrow have a distinct refusal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wrote yesterday and got this note.&nbsp; There is no need to 
add to this statement any comment.&nbsp; Papa&rsquo;s vehement antipathy to
the bare thought of any one thinking of me as a wife, and Mr. 
Nicholls&rsquo;s distress, both give me pain.&nbsp; Attachment to Mr. 
Nicholls you are aware I never entertained, but the poignant pity inspired 
by his state on Monday evening, by the hurried revelation of his sufferings
for many months, is something galling and irksome.&nbsp; That he cared 
something for me, and wanted me to care for him, I have long suspected, but
I did not know the degree or strength of his feelings.&nbsp; Dear Nell, 
good-bye.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</p>

<p><!-- page 474--><a name="page474"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
474</span>With this letter we see the tragedy beginning.&nbsp; Mr. 
Bront&euml;, with his daughter&rsquo;s fame ringing in his ears, thought 
she should do better than marry a curate with a hundred pounds per 
annum.&nbsp; For once, and for the only time in his life there is reason to
believe, his passions were thoroughly aroused.&nbsp; It is to the honour of
Mr. Nicholls, and says much for his magnanimity, that he has always 
maintained that Mr. Bront&euml; was perfectly justified in the attitude he 
adopted.&nbsp; His present feeling for Mr. Bront&euml; is one of unbounded 
respect and reverence, and the occasional unfriendly references to his 
father-in-law have pained him perhaps even more than when he has been 
himself the victim.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Attachment to Mr. Nicholls you are aware I never 
entertained.&rsquo;&nbsp; A good deal has been made of this and other 
casual references of Charlotte Bront&euml; to her slight affection for her 
future husband.&nbsp; Martha Brown, the servant, used in her latter days to
say that Charlotte would come into the kitchen and ask her if it was right 
to marry a man one did not entirely love&mdash;and Martha Brown&rsquo;s 
esteem for Mr. Nicholls was very great.&nbsp; But it is possible to make 
too much of all this.&nbsp; It is a commonplace of psychology to say that a
woman&rsquo;s love is of slow growth.&nbsp; It is quite certain that 
Charlotte Bront&euml; suffered much during this period of alienation and 
separation; that she alone secured Mr. Nicholls&rsquo;s return to Haworth, 
after his temporary estrangement from Mr. Bront&euml;; and finally, that 
the months of her married life, prior to her last illness, were the 
happiest she was destined to know.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>December</i> 18<i>th</i>, 1852.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Nell</span>,&mdash;You may well ask, how
is it? for I am sure I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; This business would seem to 
me like a dream, did not my reason tell me it has long been brewing.&nbsp; 
It puzzles me to comprehend how and whence comes this turbulence of 
feeling.</p>
<p><!-- page 475--><a name="page475"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
475</span>&lsquo;You ask how papa demeans himself to Mr. Nicholls.&nbsp; I 
only wish you were here to see papa in his present mood: you would know 
something of him.&nbsp; He just treats him with a hardness not to be bent, 
and a contempt not to be propitiated.&nbsp; The two have had no interview 
as yet; all has been done by letter.&nbsp; Papa wrote, I must say, a most 
cruel note to Mr. Nicholls on Wednesday.&nbsp; In his state of mind and 
health (for the poor man is horrifying his landlady, Martha&rsquo;s mother,
by entirely rejecting his meals) I felt that the blow must be parried, and 
I thought it right to accompany the pitiless despatch by a line to the 
effect that, while Mr. Nicholls must never expect me to reciprocate the 
feeling he had expressed, yet, at the same time, I wished to disclaim 
participation in sentiments calculated to give him pain; and I exhorted him
to maintain his courage and spirits.&nbsp; On receiving the two letters, he
set off from home.&nbsp; Yesterday came the inclosed brief epistle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must understand that a good share of papa&rsquo;s anger 
arises from the idea, not altogether groundless, that Mr. Nicholls has 
behaved with disingenuousness in so long concealing his aim.&nbsp; I am 
afraid also that papa thinks a little too much about his want of money; he 
says the match would be a degradation, that I should be throwing myself 
away, that he expects me, if I marry at all, to do very differently; in 
short, his manner of viewing the subject is on the whole far from being one
in which I can sympathise.&nbsp; My own objections arise from a sense of 
incongruity and uncongeniality in feelings, tastes, principles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How are you getting on, dear Nell, and how are all at 
Brookroyd?&nbsp; Remember me kindly to everybody.&mdash;Yours, wishing 
devoutly that papa would resume his tranquillity, and Mr. Nicholls his beef
and pudding,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Nell</span>,&mdash;I thought of you on 
New Year&rsquo;s night, and hope you got well over your formidable 
tea-making.&nbsp; I trust <!-- page 476--><a name="page476"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 476</span>that Tuesday and Wednesday will also pass 
pleasantly.&nbsp; I am busy too in my little way preparing to go to London 
this week, a matter which necessitates some little application to the 
needle.&nbsp; I find it is quite necessary I should go to superintend the 
press, as Mr. Smith seems quite determined not to let the printing get on 
till I come.&nbsp; I have actually only received three proof-sheets since I
was at Brookroyd.&nbsp; Papa wants me to go too, to be out of the way, I 
suppose; but I am sorry for one other person whom nobody pities but 
me.&nbsp; Martha is bitter against him; John Brown says &ldquo;he should 
like to shoot him.&rdquo;&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t understand the nature of 
his feelings, but I see now what they are.&nbsp; He is one of those who 
attach themselves to very few, whose sensations are close and deep, like an
underground stream, running strong, but in a narrow channel.&nbsp; He 
continues restless and ill; he carefully performs the occasional duty, but 
does not come near the church, procuring a substitute every Sunday.&nbsp; A
few days since he wrote to papa requesting permission to withdraw his 
resignation.&nbsp; Papa answered that he should only do so on condition of 
giving his written promise never again to broach the obnoxious subject 
either to him or to me.&nbsp; This he has evaded doing, so the matter 
remains unsettled.&nbsp; I feel persuaded the termination will be his 
departure for Australia.&nbsp; Dear Nell, without loving him, I don&rsquo;t
like to think of him suffering in solitude, and wish him anywhere so that 
he were happier.&nbsp; He and papa have never met or spoken yet.&nbsp; I am
very glad to learn that your mother is pretty well, and also that the piece
of challenged work is progressing.&nbsp; I hope you will not be called away
to Norfolk before I come home: I should like you to pay a visit to Haworth 
first.&nbsp; Write again soon.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>March</i> 4<i>th</i>, 1853.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;We had the parsons 
to supper as well as to tea.&nbsp; Mr. N. demeaned himself not quite 
pleasantly.&nbsp; I thought he made no effort to struggle with his 
dejection but gave way to it in a manner to draw notice; the Bishop was 
obviously <!-- page 477--><a name="page477"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
477</span>puzzled by it.&nbsp; Mr. Nicholls also showed temper once or 
twice in speaking to papa.&nbsp; Martha was beginning to tell me of certain
&ldquo;flaysome&rdquo; looks also, but I desired not to hear of them.&nbsp;
The fact is, I shall be most thankful when he is well away.&nbsp; I pity 
him, but I don&rsquo;t like that dark gloom of his.&nbsp; He dogged me up 
the lane after the evening service in no pleasant manner.&nbsp; He stopped 
also in the passage after the Bishop and the other clergy were gone into 
the room, and it was because I drew away and went upstairs that he gave 
that look which filled Martha&rsquo;s soul with horror.&nbsp; She, it 
seems, meantime, was making it her business to watch him from the kitchen 
door.&nbsp; If Mr. Nicholls be a good man at bottom, it is a sad thing that
nature has not given him the faculty to put goodness into a more attractive
form.&nbsp; Into the bargain of all the rest he managed to get up a most 
pertinacious and needless dispute with the Inspector, in listening to which
all my old unfavourable impressions revived so strongly, I fear my 
countenance could not but shew them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Nell, I consider that on the whole it is a mercy you have 
been at home and not at Norfolk during the late cold weather.&nbsp; Love to
all at Brookroyd.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</p>

Wooler would enjoy her visit to you, as much as you her company.&nbsp; Dear
Nell, I thank you sincerely for your discreet and friendly silence on the 
point alluded to.&nbsp; I had feared it would be discussed between you two,
and had an inexpressible shrinking at the thought; now less than ever does 
it seem a matter open to discussion.&nbsp; I hear nothing, and you must 
quite understand that if I feel any uneasiness it is not that of confirmed 
and fixed regard, but that anxiety which is inseparable from a state of 
absolute uncertainty about a somewhat momentous matter.&nbsp; I do not 
know, I am not sure myself, that any other termination would be better than
lasting estrangement and unbroken silence.&nbsp; Yet a good deal of pain 
has been and must be gone through in that case.&nbsp; However, to each his

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>April</i> 6<i>th</i>, 1853.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;My visit to 
Manchester is for the present put off by Mr. Morgan having written to say 
that since papa will not go to Buckingham to see him he will come to 
Yorkshire to see papa; when, I don&rsquo;t yet know, and I trust in 
goodness he will not stay long, as papa really cannot bear putting out of 
his way.&nbsp; I must wait, however, till the infliction is over.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You ask about Mr. Nicholls.&nbsp; I hear he has got a curacy, but
do not yet know where.&nbsp; I trust the news is true.&nbsp; He and papa 
never speak.&nbsp; He seems to pass a desolate life.&nbsp; He has allowed 
late circumstances so to act on him as to freeze up his manner and overcast
his countenance not only to those immediately concerned but to every 
one.&nbsp; He sits drearily in his rooms.&nbsp; If Mr. Grant or any other 
clergyman calls to see, and as they think, to cheer him, he scarcely 
speaks.&nbsp; I find he tells them nothing, seeks no confidant, rebuffs all
attempts to penetrate his mind.&nbsp; I own I respect him for this.&nbsp; 
He still lets Flossy go to his rooms, and takes him to walk.&nbsp; He still
goes over to see Mr. Sowden sometimes, and, poor fellow, that is all.&nbsp;
He looks ill and miserable.&nbsp; I think and trust in Heaven that he will 
be better as soon as he fairly gets away from Haworth.&nbsp; I pity him 
inexpressibly.&nbsp; We never meet nor speak, nor dare I look at him; 
silent pity is just all that I can give him, and as he knows nothing about 
that, it does not comfort.&nbsp; He is now grown so gloomy and reserved 
that nobody seems to like him.&nbsp; His fellow-curates shun trouble in 
that shape; the lower orders dislike it.&nbsp; Papa has a perfect antipathy
to him, and he, I fear, to papa.&nbsp; Martha hates him.&nbsp; I think he 
might almost be <i>dying</i> and they would not speak a friendly word to or
of him.&nbsp; How much of all <!-- page 479--><a name="page479"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 479</span>this he deserves I can&rsquo;t tell; certainly
he never was agreeable or amiable, and is less so now than ever, and alas! 
I do not know him well enough to be sure that there is truth and true 
affection, or only rancour and corroding disappointment at the bottom of 
his chagrin.&nbsp; In this state of things I must be, and I am, <i>entirely
passive</i>.&nbsp; I may be losing the purest gem, and to me far the most 
precious, life can give&mdash;genuine attachment&mdash;or I may be escaping
the yoke of a morose temper.&nbsp; In this doubt conscience will not suffer
me to take one step in opposition to papa&rsquo;s will, blended as that 
will is with the most bitter and unreasonable prejudices.&nbsp; So I just 
leave the matter where we must leave all important matters.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;The east winds about
which you inquire have spared me wonderfully till to-day, when I feel 
somewhat sick physically, and not very blithe mentally.&nbsp; I am not sure
that the east winds are entirely to blame for this ailment.&nbsp; Yesterday
was a strange sort of a day at church.&nbsp; It seems as if I were to be 
punished for my doubts about the nature and truth of poor Mr. 
Nicholls&rsquo;s regard.&nbsp; Having ventured on Whit Sunday to stop the 
sacrament, I got a lesson not to be repeated.&nbsp; He struggled, faltered,
then lost command over himself&mdash;stood before my eyes and in the sight 
of all the communicants white, shaking, voiceless.&nbsp; Papa was not 
there, thank God!&nbsp; Joseph Redman spoke some words to him.&nbsp; He 
made a great effort, but could only with difficulty whisper and falter 
through the service.&nbsp; I suppose he thought this would be the last 
time; he goes either this week or the next.&nbsp; I heard the women sobbing
round, and I could not quite check my own tears.&nbsp; What had happened 
was reported to papa either by Joseph Redman or John Brown; it excited only
anger, and such expressions as &ldquo;unmanly driveller.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Compassion or relenting is no more to be looked for than sap from 
firewood.</p>
<p><!-- page 480--><a name="page480"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
480</span>&lsquo;I never saw a battle more sternly fought with the feelings
than Mr. Nicholls fights with his, and when he yields momentarily, you are 
almost sickened by the sense of the strain upon him.&nbsp; However, he is 
to go, and I cannot speak to him or look at him or comfort him a whit, and 
I must submit.&nbsp; Providence is over all, that is the only 
consolation.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I cannot help 
feeling a certain satisfaction in finding that the people here are getting 
up a subscription to offer a testimonial of respect to Mr. Nicholls on his 
leaving the place.&nbsp; Many are expressing both their commiseration and 
esteem for him.&nbsp; The Churchwardens recently put the question to him 
plainly: Why was he going?&nbsp; Was it Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s fault or 
his own?&nbsp; &ldquo;His own,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; Did he blame Mr. 
Bront&euml;?&nbsp; &ldquo;No! he did not: if anybody was wrong it was 
himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was he willing to go?&nbsp; &ldquo;No! it gave him 
great pain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet he is not always right.&nbsp; I must be 
just.&nbsp; He shows a curious mixture of honour and 
obstinacy&mdash;feeling and sullenness.&nbsp; Papa addressed him at the 
school tea-drinking, with <i>constrained</i> civility, but still with 
<i>civility</i>.&nbsp; He did not reply civilly; he cut short further 
words.&nbsp; This sort of treatment offered in public is what papa never 
will forget or forgive, it inspires him with a silent bitterness not to be 
expressed.&nbsp; I am afraid both are unchristian in their mutual 
feelings.&nbsp; Nor do I know which of them is least accessible to reason 
or least likely to forgive.&nbsp; It is a dismal state of things.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The weather is fine now, dear Nell.&nbsp; We will take these 
sunny days as a good omen for your visit to Yarmouth.&nbsp; With kind 
regards to all at Brookroyd, and best wishes to yourself,&mdash;I am, yours

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;You will want to 
know about the leave-taking?&nbsp; The whole matter is but a painful 
subject, but I must treat it <!-- page 481--><a name="page481"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 481</span>briefly.&nbsp; The testimonial was presented 
in a public meeting.&nbsp; Mr. Taylor and Mr. Grant were there.&nbsp; Papa 
was not very well and I advised him to stay away, which he did.&nbsp; As to
the last Sunday, it was a cruel struggle.&nbsp; Mr. Nicholls ought not to 
have had to take any duty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He left Haworth this morning at six o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; 
Yesterday evening he called to render into papa&rsquo;s hands the deeds of 
the National School, and to say good-bye.&nbsp; They were busy 
cleaning&mdash;washing the paint, etc., in the dining-room, so he did not 
find me there.&nbsp; I would not go into the parlour to speak to him in 
papa&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; He went out, thinking he was not to see me; 
and indeed, till the very last moment, I thought it best not.&nbsp; But 
perceiving that he stayed long before going out at the gate, and 
remembering his long grief, I took courage and went out, trembling and 
miserable.&nbsp; I found him leaning against the garden door in a paroxysm 
of anguish, sobbing as women never sob.&nbsp; Of course I went straight to 
him.&nbsp; Very few words were interchanged, those few barely 
articulate.&nbsp; Several things I should have liked to ask him were swept 
entirely from my memory.&nbsp; Poor fellow!&nbsp; But he wanted such hope 
and such encouragement as I could not give him.&nbsp; Still, I trust he 
must know now that I am not cruelly blind and indifferent to his constancy 
and grief.&nbsp; For a few weeks he goes to the south of England, 
afterwards he takes a curacy somewhere in Yorkshire, but I don&rsquo;t know
where.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa has been far from strong lately.&nbsp; I dare not mention 
Mr. Nicholls&rsquo;s name to him.&nbsp; He speaks of him quietly and 
without opprobrium to others, but to me he is implacable on the 
matter.&nbsp; However, he is gone&mdash;gone, and there&rsquo;s an end of 
it.&nbsp; I see no chance of hearing a word about him in future, unless 
some stray shred of intelligence comes through Mr. Sowden or some other 
second-hand source.&nbsp; In all this it is not I who am to be pitied at 
all, and of course nobody pities me.&nbsp; They all think in Haworth that I
have disdainfully refused him.&nbsp; If pity would do Mr. Nicholls any 
good, he ought to have, and I believe has it.&nbsp; They may abuse me if 
they will; whether they do or not I can&rsquo;t tell.</p>

<i>March</i> 18<i>th</i>, 1854.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear L&aelig;titia</span>,&mdash;I was 
very glad to see your handwriting again; it is, I believe, a year since I 
heard from you.&nbsp; Again and again you have recurred to my thoughts 
lately, and I was beginning to have some sad presages as to the cause of 
your silence.&nbsp; Your letter happily does away with all these; it 
brings, on the whole, good tidings both of your papa, mamma, your sister, 
and, last but not least, your dear respected English self.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear father has borne the severe winter very well, a 
circumstance for which I feel the more thankful, as he had many weeks of 
very precarious health last summer, following an attack from which he 
suffered last June, and which for a few hours deprived him totally of 
sight, though neither his mind, speech, nor even his powers of motion were 
in the least affected.&nbsp; I can hardly tell you how thankful I was, dear
L&aelig;titia, when, after that dreary and almost despairing interval of 
utter darkness, some gleam of daylight became visible to him once 
more.&nbsp; I had feared that paralysis had seized the optic nerve.&nbsp; A
sort of mist remained for a long time, and indeed his vision is not yet 
perfectly clear, but he can read, write, and walk about, and he preaches 
<i>twice</i> every Sunday, the curate only reading the prayers.&nbsp; 
<i>You</i> can well understand how earnestly I pray that sight may be 
spared him to the end; he so dreads the privation of blindness.&nbsp; His 
mind is just as strong and active as ever, and politics interest him as 
they do <i>your</i> papa.&nbsp; The Czar, the war, the alliance between 
France and England&mdash;into all these things he throws himself heart and 
soul.&nbsp; They seem to carry him back to his comparatively young days, 
and to renew the excitement of the last great European struggle.&nbsp; Of 
course, my father&rsquo;s sympathies, and mine too, are all with justice 
and Europe against tyranny and Russia.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Circumstanced as I have been, you will comprehend that I <!-- 
page 483--><a name="page483"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 483</span>had 
neither the leisure nor inclination to go from home much during the past 
year.&nbsp; I spent a week with Mrs. Gaskell in the spring, and a fortnight
with some other friends more recently, and that includes the whole of my 
visiting since I saw you last.&nbsp; My life is indeed very uniform and 
retired, more so than is quite healthful either for mind or body; yet I 
feel reason for often renewed feelings of gratitude in the sort of support 
which still comes and cheers me from time to time.&nbsp; My health, though 
not unbroken, is, I sometimes fancy, rather stronger on the whole than it 
was three years ago; headache and dyspepsia are my worst ailments.&nbsp; 
Whether I shall come up to town this season for a few days I do not yet 
know; but if I do I shall hope to call in Phillimore Place.&nbsp; With 
kindest remembrances to your papa, mamma, and sisters,&mdash;I am, dear 
L&aelig;titia, affectionately yours,</p>

<p>Mr. Nicholls&rsquo;s successor did not prove acceptable to Mr. 
Bront&euml;.&nbsp; He complained again and again, and one day Charlotte 
turned upon her father and told him pretty frankly that he was alone to 
blame&mdash;that he had only to let her marry Mr. Nicholls, with whom she 
corresponded and whom she really loved, and all would be well.&nbsp; A 
little arrangement, the transfer of Mr. Nicholls&rsquo;s successor, Mr. De

<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>March</i> 28<i>th</i>, 1854.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;The inclosure in 
yours of yesterday puzzled me at first, for I did not immediately recognise
my own hand-writing; when I did, the sensation was one of consternation and
vexation, as the letter ought by all means to have gone on Friday.&nbsp; It
was intended to relieve him of great anxiety.&nbsp; However, I trust he 
will get it to-day; and on the whole, when I think it over, I can only be 
thankful that the mistake was no worse, and did not throw the letter into 
the hands of some <!-- page 484--><a name="page484"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 484</span>indifferent and unscrupulous person.&nbsp; I 
wrote it after some days of indisposition and uneasiness, and when I felt 
weak and unfit to write.&nbsp; While writing to him, I was at the same time
intending to answer your note, which I suppose accounts for the confusion 
of ideas, shown in the mixed and blundering address.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish you could come about Easter rather than at another time, 
for this reason: Mr. Nicholls, if not prevented, proposes coming over 
then.&nbsp; I suppose he will stay at Mr. Grant&rsquo;s, as he has done two
or three times before, but he will be frequently coming here, which would 
enliven your visit a little.&nbsp; Perhaps, too, he might take a walk with 
us occasionally.&nbsp; Altogether it would be a little change, such as, you
know, I could not always offer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If all be well he will come under different circumstances to any 
that have attended his visits before; were it otherwise, I should not ask 
you to meet him, for when aspects are gloomy and unpropitious, the fewer 
there are to suffer from the cloud the better.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was here in January and was then received, but not 
pleasantly.&nbsp; I trust it will be a little different now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa breakfasts in bed and has not yet risen; his bronchitis is 
still troublesome.&nbsp; I had a bad week last week, but am greatly better 
now, for my mind is a little relieved, though very sedate, and rising only 
to expectations the most moderate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sometime, perhaps in May, I may hope to come to Brookroyd, but, 
as you will understand from what I have now stated, I could not come 
before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Think it over, dear Nell, and come to Haworth if you can.&nbsp; 
Write as soon as you can decide.&mdash;Yours affectionately,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;You certainly 
were right in your second interpretation of my note.&nbsp; I am too well 
aware of the dulness of Haworth for any visitor, not to be glad to avail 
myself of the chance of offering even a slight change.&nbsp; But this 
morning my <!-- page 485--><a name="page485"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
485</span>little plans have been disarranged by an intimation that Mr. 
Nicholls is coming on Monday.&nbsp; I thought to put him off, but have not 
succeeded.&nbsp; As Easter now consequently seems an unfavourable period 
both from your point of view and mine, we will adjourn it till a better 
opportunity offers.&nbsp; Meantime, I thank you, dear Ellen, for your kind 
offer to come in case I wanted you.&nbsp; Papa is still very far from well:
his cough very troublesome, and a good deal of inflammatory action in the 
chest.&nbsp; To-day he seems somewhat better than yesterday, and I 
earnestly hope the improvement may continue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With kind regards to your mother and all at Brookroyd,&mdash;I 
am, dear Ellen, yours affectionately,</p>

<i>April</i> 11<i>th</i>, 1854.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;Thank you for the 
collar; it is very pretty, and I will wear it for the sake of her who made 
and gave it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Nicholls came on Monday, and was here all last week.&nbsp; 
Matters have progressed thus since July.&nbsp; He renewed his visit in 
September, but then matters so fell out that I saw little of him.&nbsp; He 
continued to write.&nbsp; The correspondence pressed on my mind.&nbsp; I 
grew very miserable in keeping it from papa.&nbsp; At last sheer pain made 
me gather courage to break it.&nbsp; I told all.&nbsp; It was very hard and
rough work at the time, but the issue after a few days was that I obtained 
leave to continue the communication.&nbsp; Mr. Nicholls came in January; he
was ten days in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; I saw much of him.&nbsp; I had 
stipulated with papa for opportunity to become better acquainted.&nbsp; I 
had it, and all I learnt inclined me to esteem and affection.&nbsp; Still 
papa was very, very hostile, bitterly unjust.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told Mr. Nicholls the great obstacle that lay in his way.&nbsp;
He has persevered.&nbsp; The result of this, his last visit, is, that 
papa&rsquo;s consent is gained, that his respect, I believe, is won, for 
Mr. Nicholls has in all things proved himself disinterested and 
forbearing.&nbsp; Certainly, I must respect him, nor can I withhold from 
him more than mere cool respect.&nbsp; In fact, dear Ellen, I am 
engaged.</p>
<p><!-- page 486--><a name="page486"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 
486</span>&lsquo;Mr. Nicholls, in the course of a few months, will return 
to the curacy of Haworth.&nbsp; I stipulated that I would not leave papa; 
and to papa himself I proposed a plan of residence which should maintain 
his seclusion and convenience uninvaded, and in a pecuniary sense bring him
gain instead of loss.&nbsp; What seemed at one time impossible is now 
arranged, and papa begins really to take a pleasure in the prospect.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For myself, dear Ellen, while thankful to One who seems to have 
guided me through much difficulty, much and deep distress and perplexity of
mind, I am still very calm, very inexpectant.&nbsp; What I taste of 
happiness is of the soberest order.&nbsp; I trust to love my husband.&nbsp;
I am grateful for his tender love to me.&nbsp; I believe him to be an 
affectionate, a conscientious, a high-principled man; and if, with all 
this, I should yield to regrets that fine talents, congenial tastes and 
thoughts are not added, it seems to me I should be most presumptuous and 
thankless.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Providence offers me this destiny.&nbsp; Doubtless, then, it is 
the best for me.&nbsp; Nor do I shrink from wishing those dear to me one 
not less happy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is possible that our marriage may take place in the course of 
the summer.&nbsp; Mr. Nicholls wishes it to be in July.&nbsp; He spoke of 
you with great kindness, and said he hoped you would be at our 
wedding.&nbsp; I said I thought of having no other bridesmaid.&nbsp; Did I 
say rightly?&nbsp; I mean the marriage to be literally as quiet as 
possible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not mention these things just yet.&nbsp; I mean to write to 
Miss Wooler shortly.&nbsp; Good-bye.&nbsp; There is a strange half-sad 
feeling in making these announcements.&nbsp; The whole thing is something 
other than imagination paints it beforehand; cares, fears, come mixed 
inextricably with hopes.&nbsp; I trust yet to talk the matter over with 
you.&nbsp; Often last week I wished for your presence and said so to Mr. 
Nicholls&mdash;Arthur, as I now call him, but he said it was the only time 
and place when he could not have wished to see you.&nbsp; 
Good-bye.&mdash;Yours affectionately,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My own dear Nell</span>,&mdash;I hope to see 
you somewhere about the second week in May.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Manchester visit is still hanging over my head.&nbsp; I have 
deferred it, and deferred it, but have finally promised to go about the 
beginning of next month.&nbsp; I shall only stay three days, then I spend 
two or three days at Hunsworth, then come to Brookroyd.&nbsp; The three 
visits must be compressed into the space of a fortnight, if possible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose I shall have to go to Leeds.&nbsp; My purchases cannot 
be either expensive or extensive.&nbsp; You must just resolve in your head 
the bonnets and dresses; something that can be turned to decent use and 
worn after the wedding-day will be best, I think.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wrote immediately to Miss Wooler and received a truly kind 
letter from her this morning.&nbsp; If you think she would like to come to 
the marriage I will not fail to ask her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa&rsquo;s mind seems wholly changed about the matter, and he 
has said both to me and when I was not there, how much happier he feels 
since he allowed all to be settled.&nbsp; It is a wonderful relief for me 
to hear him treat the thing rationally, to talk over with him themes on 
which once I dared not touch.&nbsp; He is rather anxious things should get 
forward now, and takes quite an interest in the arrangement of 
preliminaries.&nbsp; His health improves daily, though this east wind still
keeps up a slight irritation in the throat and chest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The feeling which had been disappointed in papa was ambition, 
paternal pride&mdash;ever a restless feeling, as we all know.&nbsp; Now 
that this unquiet spirit is exorcised, justice, which was once quite 
forgotten, is once more listened to, and affection, I hope, resumes some 
power.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My hope is that in the end this arrangement will turn out more 
truly to papa&rsquo;s advantage than any other it was in my power to 
achieve.&nbsp; Mr. Nicholls in his last letter refers touchingly to his 
earnest desire to prove his gratitude to papa, by offering support and 
consolation to his declining age.&nbsp; This will <!-- page 488--><a 
name="page488"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 488</span>not be mere talk with
him&mdash;he is no talker, no dealer in professions.&mdash;Yours 
affectionately,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<i>April</i> 28<i>th</i>, 1854.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I have delayed 
writing till I could give you some clear notion of my movements.&nbsp; If 
all be well, I go to Manchester on the 1st of May.&nbsp; Thence, on 
Thursday, to Hunsworth till Monday, when (D.V.) I come to Brookroyd.&nbsp; 
I must be at home by the close of the week.&nbsp; Papa, thank God! 
continues to improve much.&nbsp; He preached twice on Sunday and again on 
Wednesday, and was not tired; his mind and mood are different to what they 
were, so much more cheerful and quiet.&nbsp; I trust the illusions of 
ambition are quite dissipated, and that he really sees it is better to 
relieve a suffering and faithful heart, to secure its fidelity, a solid 
good, than unfeelingly to abandon one who is truly attached to his interest
as well as mine, and pursue some vain empty shadow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thank you, dear Ellen, for your kind invitation to Mr. 
Nicholls.&nbsp; He was asked likewise to Manchester and Hunsworth.&nbsp; I 
would not have opposed his coming had there been no real obstacle to the 
arrangement&mdash;certain little awkwardnesses of feeling I would have 
tried to get over for the sake of introducing him to old friends; but it so
happens that he cannot leave on account of his rector&rsquo;s 
absence.&nbsp; Mr. C. will be in town with his family till June, and he 
always stipulates that his curate shall remain at Kirk-Smeaton while he is 
away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did you get on at the Oratorio?&nbsp; And what did Miss 
Wooler say to the proposal of being at the wedding?&nbsp; I have many 
points to discuss when I see you.&nbsp; I hope your mother and all are 
well.&nbsp; With kind remembrances to them, and true love to you,&mdash;I

are, and whether that <!-- page 489--><a name="page489"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 489</span>harassing cough is better.&nbsp; Be 
scrupulously cautious about undue exposure.&nbsp; Just now, dear Ellen, an 
hour&rsquo;s inadvertence might cause you to be really ill.&nbsp; So once 
again, take care.&nbsp; Since I came home I have been very busy 
stitching.&nbsp; The little new room is got into order, and the green and 
white curtains are up; they exactly suit the papering, and look neat and 
clean enough.&nbsp; I had a letter a day or two since announcing that Mr. 
Nicholls comes to-morrow.&nbsp; I feel anxious about him, more anxious on 
one point than I dare quite express to myself.&nbsp; It seems he has again 
been suffering sharply from his rheumatic affection.&nbsp; I hear this not 
from himself, but from another quarter.&nbsp; He was ill while I was at 
Manchester and Brookroyd.&nbsp; He uttered no complaint to me, dropped no 
hint on the subject.&nbsp; Alas! he was hoping he had got the better of it,
and I know how this contradiction of his hopes will sadden him.&nbsp; For 
unselfish reasons he did so earnestly wish this complaint might not become 
chronic.&nbsp; I fear, I fear.&nbsp; But, however, I mean to stand by him 
now, whether in weal or woe.&nbsp; This liability to rheumatic pain was one
of the strong arguments used against the marriage.&nbsp; It did not weigh 
somehow.&nbsp; If he is doomed to suffer, it seems that so much the more 
will he need care and help.&nbsp; And yet the ultimate possibilities of 
such a case are appalling.&nbsp; You remember your aunt.&nbsp; Well, come 
what may, God help and strengthen both him and me.&nbsp; I look forward to 
to-morrow with a mixture of impatience and anxiety.&nbsp; Poor fellow! I 
want to see with my own eyes how he is.</p>

frightened.&nbsp; However, inquiring gradually relieved me.&nbsp; In short,
I soon <!-- page 490--><a name="page490"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

soundly.&nbsp; The patient had wholesome treatment while he was at Haworth,
and went away singularly better; perfectly unreasonable, however, on some 
points, as his fallible sex are not ashamed to be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Man is, indeed, an amazing piece of mechanism when you see, so to
speak, the full weakness of what he calls his strength.&nbsp; There is not 
a female child above the age of eight but might rebuke him for spoilt

table-cloth and have put it on.</p>

how soon he is depressed and how soon revived.&nbsp; It makes me feel so 
thankful when he is better.&nbsp; I am thankful too that you are stronger, 
dear Nell.&nbsp; My worthy acquaintance at Kirk-Smeaton refuses to 
acknowledge himself better yet.&nbsp; I am uneasy about not writing to Miss
Wooler.&nbsp; I fear she will think me negligent, while I am only busy and 
bothered.&nbsp; I want to clear up my needlework a little, and have been

me for a full week.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like the card very well, but not the envelope.&nbsp; I should 
like a perfectly plain envelope with a silver initial.</p>

had time to have them unpacked, so I don&rsquo;t know what they are

<i>August</i> 9<i>th</i>, 1854.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I earnestly hope you
are by yourself now, and relieved from the fag of entertaining 
guests.&nbsp; You do not complain, but I am afraid you have had too much of
it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since I came home I have not had an unemployed moment.&nbsp; My 
life is changed indeed: to be wanted continually, to be constantly called 
for and occupied seems so strange; yet it is a marvellously good 
thing.&nbsp; As yet I don&rsquo;t quite understand how some wives grow so 
selfish.&nbsp; As far as my experience of matrimony goes, I think it tends 
to draw you out of, and away from yourself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have had sundry callers this week.&nbsp; Yesterday Mr. Sowden 
and another gentleman dined here, and Mr. and Mrs. Grant joined them at 
tea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not think we shall go to Brookroyd soon, on papa&rsquo;s 
account.&nbsp; I do not wish again to leave home for a time, but I trust 
you will ere long come here.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I really like Mr. Sowden very well.&nbsp; He asked after 
you.&nbsp; Mr. Nicholls told him we expected you would be coming to stay 
with us in the course of three or four weeks, and that he should then 
invite him over again as he wished us to take sundry rather long walks, and
as he should have his wife to look after, and she was trouble enough, it 
would be quite necessary to have a guardian for the other lady.&nbsp; Mr. 
Sowden seemed perfectly acquiescent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Nell, during the last six weeks, the colour of my thoughts 
is a good deal changed: I know more of the realities of life than I once 
did.&nbsp; I think many false ideas are propagated, perhaps 
unintentionally.&nbsp; I think those married women who indiscriminately 
urge their acquaintance to marry, much to blame.&nbsp; For my part, I can 
only say with deeper sincerity and <!-- page 493--><a 
name="page493"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 493</span>fuller significance 
what I always said in theory, &ldquo;Wait God&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Indeed, indeed, Nell, it is a solemn and strange and perilous thing for a 
woman to become a wife.&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s lot is far, far different.&nbsp; 
Tell me when you think you can come.&nbsp; Papa is better, but not 
well.&nbsp; How is your mother? give my love to her.&mdash;Yours 
faithfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">C. B. 
Nicholls</span>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have I told you how much better Mr. Nicholls is?&nbsp; He looks 
quite strong and hale; he gained 12 lbs. during the four weeks we were in 
Ireland.&nbsp; To see this improvement in him has been a main source of 
happiness to me, and to speak truth, a subject of wonder too.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;Can you come here on
Wednesday week (Sept.&nbsp; 6th)?&nbsp; Try to arrange matters to do so if 
possible, for it will be better than to delay your visit till the days grow
cold and short.&nbsp; I want to see you again, dear Nell, and my husband 
too will receive you with pleasure; and he is not diffuse of his courtesies
or partialities, I can assure you.&nbsp; One friendly word from him means 
as much as twenty from most people.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have been busy lately giving a supper and tea-drinking to the 
singers, ringers, Sunday-school teachers, and all the scholars of the 
Sunday and National Schools, amounting in all to some 500 souls.&nbsp; It 
gave satisfaction and went off well.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I send a French 
paper to-day.&nbsp; You would almost think I had given them up, it is so 
long since one was despatched.&nbsp; The fact is, they had accumulated to 
quite a pile during my absence.&nbsp; I wished to look them over before 
sending them off, and as yet I have scarcely found time.&nbsp; That same 
Time is an article of which I once had a large stock always on <!-- page 
494--><a name="page494"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 494</span>hand; where 
it is all gone now it would be difficult to say, but my moments are very 
fully occupied.&nbsp; Take warning, Ellen, the married woman can call but a
very small portion of each day her own.&nbsp; Not that I complain of this 
sort of monopoly as yet, and I hope I never shall incline to regard it as a
misfortune, but it certainly exists.&nbsp; We were both disappointed that 
you could not come on the day I mentioned.&nbsp; I have grudged this 
splendid weather very much.&nbsp; The moors are in glory, I never saw them 
fuller of purple bloom.&nbsp; I wanted you to see them at their best; they 
are just turning now, and in another week, I fear, will be faded and 
sere.&nbsp; As soon as ever you can leave home, be sure to write and let me
know.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa continues greatly better.&nbsp; My husband flourishes; he 
begins indeed to express some slight alarm at the growing improvement in 
his condition.&nbsp; I think I am decent, better certainly than I was two 
months ago, but people don&rsquo;t compliment me as they do 
Arthur&mdash;excuse the name, it has grown natural to use it now.&nbsp; I 
trust, dear Nell, that you are all well at Brookroyd, and that your 
visiting stirs are pretty nearly over.&nbsp; I compassionate you from my

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;Arthur wishes you 
would burn my letters.&nbsp; He was out when I commenced this letter, but 
he has just come in.&nbsp; It is not &ldquo;old friends&rdquo; he 
mistrusts, he says, but the chances of war&mdash;the accidental passing of 
letters into hands and under eyes for which they were never written.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All this seems mighty amusing to me; it is a man&rsquo;s mode of 
viewing correspondence.&nbsp; Men&rsquo;s letters are proverbially 
uninteresting and uncommunicative.&nbsp; I never quite knew before why they
made them so.&nbsp; They may be right in a sense: strange chances do fall 
out certainly.&nbsp; As to my own notes, I never thought of attaching 
importance to them or <!-- page 495--><a name="page495"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 495</span>considering their fate, till Arthur seemed to 
reflect on both so seriously.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will write again next week if all be well to name a day for 
coming to see you.&nbsp; I am sure you want, or at least ought to have, a 
little rest before you are bothered with more company; but whenever I come,
I suppose, dear Nell, under present circumstances, it will be a quiet 
visit, and that I shall not need to bring more than a plain dress or 
two.&nbsp; Tell me this when you write.&mdash;Believe me faithfully

<i>November</i> 21<i>st</i>, 1854,</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;You ask about Mr. 
Sowden&rsquo;s matter.&nbsp; He walked over here on a wild rainy day.&nbsp;
We talked it over.&nbsp; He is quite disposed to entertain the proposal, 
but of course there must be close inquiry and ripe consideration before 
either he or the patron decide.&nbsp; Meantime Mr. Sowden <a 
name="citation495"></a><a href="#footnote495" class="citation">[495]</a> is
most anxious that the affairs be kept absolutely quiet; in the event of 
disappointment it would be both painful and injurious to him if it should 
be rumoured at Hebden Bridge that he has had thoughts of leaving.&nbsp; 
Arthur says if a whisper gets out these things fly from parson to parson 
like wildfire.&nbsp; I cannot <!-- page 496--><a name="page496"></a><span 
class="pagenum">p. 496</span>help somehow wishing that the matter should be
arranged, if all on examination is found tolerably satisfactory.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa continues pretty well, I am thankful to say; his deafness is
wonderfully relieved.&nbsp; Winter seems to suit him better than summer; 
besides, he is settled and content, as I perceive with gratitude to 
God.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Ellen, I wish you well through every trouble.&nbsp; Arthur 
is not in just now or he would send a kind message.&mdash;Believe me, yours
faithfully,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;Arthur somewhat 
demurs about my going to Brookroyd as yet; fever, you know, is a formidable
word.&nbsp; I cannot say I entertain any apprehensions myself further than 
this, that I should be terribly bothered at the idea of being taken ill 
from home and causing trouble; and strangers are sometimes more liable to 
infection than persons living in the house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Sowden has seen Sir J. K. Shuttleworth, but I fancy the 
matter is very uncertain as yet.&nbsp; It seems the Bishop of Manchester 
stipulates that the clergyman chosen should, if possible, be from his own 
diocese, and this, Arthur says, is quite right and just.&nbsp; An exception
would have been made in Arthur&rsquo;s favour, but the case is not so clear
with Mr. Sowden.&nbsp; However, no harm will have been done if the matter 
does not take wind, as I trust it will not.&nbsp; Write very soon, dear 
Nell, and,&mdash;Believe me, yours faithfully,</p>

<i>December</i> 7<i>th</i>, 1854.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I shall not get 
leave to go to Brookroyd before Christmas now, so do not expect me.&nbsp; 
For my own part I really should have no fear, and if it just depended on me
I should come.&nbsp; But these matters are not quite in my power now: 
another must be consulted; and where his wish and <!-- page 497--><a 
name="page497"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 497</span>judgment have a 
decided bias to a particular course, I make no stir, but just adopt 
it.&nbsp; Arthur is sorry to disappoint both you and me, but it is his 
fixed wish that a few weeks should be allowed yet to elapse before we 
meet.&nbsp; Probably he is confirmed in this desire by my having a cold at 
present.&nbsp; I did not achieve the walk to the waterfall with 
impunity.&nbsp; Though I changed my wet things immediately on returning 
home, yet I felt a chill afterwards, and the same night had sore throat and
cold; however, I am better now, but not quite well.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did I tell you that our poor little Flossy is dead?&nbsp; He 
drooped for a single day, and died quietly in the night without pain.&nbsp;
The loss even of a dog was very saddening, yet perhaps no dog ever had a 
happier life or an easier death.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Papa continues pretty well, I am happy to say, and my dear boy 
flourishes.&nbsp; I do not mean that he continues to grow stouter, which 
one would not desire, but he keeps in excellent condition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would wonder, I dare say, at the long disappearance of the 
French paper.&nbsp; I had got such an accumulation of them unread that I 
thought I would not wait to send the old ones; now you will receive them 
regularly.&nbsp; I am writing in haste.&nbsp; It is almost inexplicable to 
me that I seem so often hurried now; but the fact is, whenever Arthur is in
I must have occupations in which he can share, or which will not at least 
divert my attention from him&mdash;thus a multitude of little matters get 
put off till he goes out, and then I am quite busy.&nbsp; Goodbye, dear 
Ellen, I hope we shall meet soon.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;I return the

weather.&nbsp; I do not know whether it has been as bad with you as with 
us, but here for three weeks we have had little else than a succession of 
hurricanes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In your last you asked about Mr. Sowden and Sir James.&nbsp; I 
fear Mr. Sowden has little chance of the living; he had heard nothing more 
of it the last time he wrote to Arthur, and in a note he had from Sir James
yesterday the subject is not mentioned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You inquire too after Mrs. Gaskell.&nbsp; She has not been here, 
and I think I should not like her to come now till summer.&nbsp; She is 
very busy with her story of <i>North and South</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must make this note short that it may not be overweight.&nbsp; 
Arthur joins me in sincere good wishes for a happy Christmas, and many of 
them to you and yours.&nbsp; He is well, thank God, and so am I, and he is

<p>At the beginning of 1855 Mr. and Mrs. Nicholls visited Sir James 
Kay-Shuttleworth at Gawthorpe.&nbsp; I know of only four letters by her, 
written in this year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Haworth</span>, 
<i>January</i> 19<i>th</i>, 1855.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;Since our return 
from Gawthorpe we have had a Mr. Bell, one of Arthur&rsquo;s cousins, 
staying with us.&nbsp; It was a great pleasure.&nbsp; I wish you could have
seen him and made his acquaintance; a true gentleman by nature and 
cultivation is not after all an everyday thing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to the living of Habergham or Padiham, it appears the <!-- 
page 499--><a name="page499"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 499</span>chance 
is doubtful at present for anybody.&nbsp; The present incumbent wishes to 
retract his resignation, and declares his intention of appointing a curate 
for two years.&nbsp; I fear Mr. Sowden hardly produced a favourable 
impression; a strong wish was expressed that Arthur could come, but that is
out of the question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I very much wish to come to Brookroyd, and I hope to be able to 
write with certainty and fix Wednesday, the 31st January, as the day; but 
the fact is I am not sure whether I shall be well enough to leave 
home.&nbsp; At present I should be a most tedious visitor.&nbsp; My health 
has been really very good since my return from Ireland till about ten days 
ago, when the stomach seemed quite suddenly to lose its tone; indigestion 
and continual faint sickness have been my portion ever since.&nbsp; 
Don&rsquo;t conjecture, dear Nell, for it is too soon yet, though I 
certainly never before felt as I have done lately.&nbsp; But keep the 
matter wholly to yourself, for I can come to no decided opinion at 
present.&nbsp; I am rather mortified to lose my good looks and grow thin as
I am doing just when I thought of going to Brookroyd.&nbsp; Dear Ellen, I 
want to see you, and I hope I shall see you well.&nbsp; My love to 
all.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</p>

<p>There were three more letters, but they were written in pencil from her 
deathbed.&nbsp; Two of them are printed by Mrs. Gaskell&mdash;one to Miss 
Nussey, the other to Miss Wheelwright.&nbsp; Here is the third and last of 
all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">TO MISS ELLEN NUSSEY</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Ellen</span>,&mdash;Thank you very 
much for Mrs. Hewitt&rsquo;s sensible clear letter.&nbsp; Thank her 
too.&nbsp; In much her case was wonderfully like mine, but I am reduced to 
greater weakness; the skeleton emaciation is the same.&nbsp; I cannot 
talk.&nbsp; Even to my dear, patient, constant Arthur I can say but few 
words at once.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These last two days I have been somewhat better, and <!-- page 
500--><a name="page500"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 500</span>have taken 
some beef-tea, a spoonful of wine and water, a mouthful of light pudding at
different times.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear Ellen, I realise full well what you have gone through and 
will have to go through with poor Mercy.&nbsp; Oh, may you continue to be 
supported and not sink.&nbsp; Sickness here has been terribly rife.&nbsp; 
Kindest regards to Mr. and Mrs. Clapham, your mother, Mercy.&nbsp; Write 
when you can.&mdash;Yours,</p>

<p>Little remains to be said.&nbsp; This is not a biography but a bundle of
correspondence, and I have only to state that Mrs. Nicholls died of an 
illness incidental to childbirth on March 31st 1855, and was buried in the 
Bront&euml; tomb in Haworth church.&nbsp; Her will runs as 
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

Majesty&rsquo;s High Court of Justice.</p>
<p><i>In the name of God</i>.&nbsp; <i>Amen</i>.&nbsp; <i>I</i>, <span

</blockquote>
<p>Testatrix died 31st March 1855.</p>
<p>It is easy as fruitless to mourn over &lsquo;unfulfilled renown,&rsquo; 
but it is not easy to believe that the future had any great things in 
store.&nbsp; Miss Bront&euml;&rsquo;s four novels will remain for all time 
imperishable monuments of her power.&nbsp; She had touched with effect in 
two of them all that she knew of her home surroundings, and in two others 
all that was revealed to her of a wider life.&nbsp; More she could not have
done with equal effect had she lived to be eighty.&nbsp; Hers was, it is 
true, a sad life, but such gifts as these rarely bring happiness with 
them.&nbsp; It was surely something to have tasted the sweets of fame, and 
a fame so indisputably lasting.</p>
<p>Mr. Nicholls stayed on at Haworth for the six years that followed his 
wife&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; When Mr. Bront&euml; died he returned to 
Ireland.&nbsp; Some years later he married again&mdash;a cousin, Miss Bell 
by name.&nbsp; That second marriage has been one of unmixed 
blessedness.&nbsp; I found him in a home of supreme simplicity and charm, 
esteemed by all who knew him and idolised in his own household.&nbsp; It 
was not difficult to understand that Charlotte Bront&euml; had loved him 
and had fought down parental opposition in his behalf.&nbsp; The qualities 
of gentleness, sincerity, unaffected piety, and delicacy of mind are his; 
and he is beautifully jealous, not only for the <!-- page 502--><a 
name="page502"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 502</span>fair fame of Currer 
Bell, but&mdash;what she would equally have loved&mdash;for her father, who
also has had much undue detraction in the years that are past.&nbsp; That 
Mr. Nicholls may long continue to enjoy the kindly calm of his Irish home 
will be the wish of all who have read of his own continuous devotion to a 
wife who must ever rank among the greatest of her sex.</p>

but Miss Charlotte Branwell of Penzance writes to me as 
follows:&mdash;&rsquo;My Aunt Maria Branwell, after the death of her 
parents, went to Yorkshire on a visit to her relatives, where she met the 
Rev. Patrick Bront&euml;.&nbsp; They soon became engaged to be 
married.&nbsp; Jane Fennell was previously engaged to the Rev. William 
Morgan.&nbsp; And when the time arrived for their marriage, Mr. Fennell 
said he should have to give his daughter and niece away, and if so, he 
could not marry them; so it was arranged that Mr. Morgan should marry Mr. 
Bront&euml; and Maria Branwell, and afterwards Mr. Bront&euml; should 
perform the same kindly office towards Mr. Morgan and Jane Fennell.&nbsp; 
So the bridegrooms married each other and the brides acted as bridesmaids 
to each other.&nbsp; My father and mother, Joseph and Charlotte Branwell, 
were married at Madron, which was then the parish church of Penzance, on 
the same day and hour.&nbsp; Perhaps a similar case never happened before 
or since: two sisters and four first cousins being united in holy matrimony
at one and the same time.&nbsp; And they were all happy marriages.&nbsp; 
Mr. Bront&euml; was perhaps peculiar, but I have always heard my own dear 
mother say that he was devotedly fond of his wife, and she of him.&nbsp; 
These marriages were solemnised on the 18th of December 1812.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Your letter which I have 
received this morning gives both to Mr. Nicholls and me great 
uneasiness.&nbsp; It would seem that application has been made to the Duke 
of Devonshire for money to aid the subscription in reference to the expense
of apparatus for heating our church and schools.&nbsp; This has been done 
without our knowledge, and most assuredly, had we known it, would have met 
with our strongest opposition.&nbsp; We have no claim on the Duke.&nbsp; 
His Grace honour&rsquo;d us with a visit, in token of his respect for the 
memory of the dead, and his liberality and munificence are well and widely 
known; and the mercenary, taking an unfair advantage of these 
circumstances, have taken a step which both Mr. Nicholls and I utterly 
regret and condemn.&nbsp; In answer to your query, I may state that the 
whole expense for both the schools and church is about one hundred pounds; 
and that after what has been and may be subscribed, there may fifty pounds 
remain as a debt.&nbsp; But this may, and ought, to be raised by the 
inhabitants, in the next year after the depression of trade shall, it is 
hoped, have passed away.&nbsp; I have written to His Grace on the

class="footnote">[74]</a>&nbsp; At the same time it is worth while quoting 
from a letter by &lsquo;A. H.&rsquo; in August 1855.&nbsp; A. H. was a 
teacher who was at Cowan Bridge during the time of the residence of the 
little Bront&euml;s there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;In July 1824 the Rev. Mr. Bront&euml; arrived at Cowan Bridge 
with two of his daughters, Maria and Elizabeth, 12 and 10 years of 
age.&nbsp; The children were delicate; both had but recently recovered from
the measles and whooping-cough&mdash;so recently, indeed, that doubts were 
entertained whether they could be admitted with safety to the other 
pupils.&nbsp; They were received, however, and went on so well that in 
September their father returned, bringing with him two more of his 
children&mdash;Charlotte, 9 [she was really but 8] and Emily, 6 years of 
age.&nbsp; During both these visits Mr. Bront&euml; lodged at the school, 
sat at the same table with the children, saw the whole routine of the 
establishment, and, so far as I have ever known, was satisfied with 
everything that came under his observation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The two younger children enjoyed uniformly good 
health.&rdquo;&nbsp; Charlotte was a general favourite.&nbsp; To the best 
of my recollection she was never under disgrace, however slight; punishment
she certainly did <i>not </i>experience while she was at Cowan Bridge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In size, Charlotte was remarkably diminutive; and if, as has been
recently asserted, she never grew an inch after leaving the Clergy 
Daughters&rsquo; School, she must have been a <i>literal dwarf</i>, and 
could not have obtained a situation as teacher in a school at Brussels, or 
anywhere else; the idea is absurd.&nbsp; In respect of the treatment of the
pupils at Cowan Bridge, I will say that neither Mr. Bront&euml;&rsquo;s 
daughters nor any other of the children were denied a sufficient quantity 
of food.&nbsp; Any statement to the contrary is entirely false.&nbsp; The 
daily dinner consisted of meat, vegetables, and pudding, in abundance; the 
children were permitted, and expected, to ask for whatever they desired, 
and were never limited.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has been remarked that the food of the school was such that 
none but starving children could eat it; and in support of this statement 
reference is made to a certain occasion when the medical attendant was 
consulted about it.&nbsp; In reply to this, let me say that during the 
spring of 1825 a low fever, although not an alarming one, prevailed in the 
school, and the managers, naturally anxious to ascertain whether any local 
cause occasioned the epidemic, took an opportunity to ask the 
physician&rsquo;s opinion of the food that happened to be then on the 
table.&nbsp; I recollect that he spoke rather scornfully of a baked rice 
pudding; but as the ingredients of this dish were chiefly, rice, sugar, and
milk, its effects could hardly have been so serious as have been 
affirmed.&nbsp; I thus furnish you with the simple fact from which those 
statements have been manufactured.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not the least hesitation in saying that, upon the whole, 
the comforts were as many and the privations as few at Cowan Bridge as can 
well be found in so large an establishment.&nbsp; How far young or delicate
children are able to contend with the necessary evils of a public school 
is, in my opinion, a very grave question, and does not enter into the 
present discussion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The younger children in all larger institutions are liable to be 
oppressed; but the exposure to this evil at Cowan Bridge was not more than 
in other schools, but, as I believe, far less.&nbsp; Then, again, 
thoughtless servants will occasionally spoil food, even in private 
families; and in public schools they are likely to be still less 
particular, unless they are well looked after.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But in this respect the institution in question compares very 
favourably with other and more expensive schools, as from personal 
experience I have reason to know.&mdash;A.H., August 
1855.&rsquo;&mdash;From <i>A Vindication of the Clergy Daughters&rsquo;

sent one of her little pupils a gift-book during the holidays.&nbsp; The

<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Aunt</span>,&mdash;I have heard nothing 
of Miss Wooler yet since I wrote to her intimating that I would accept her 
offer.&nbsp; I cannot conjecture the reason of this long silence, unless 
some unforeseen impediment has occurred in concluding the bargain.&nbsp; 
Meantime, a plan has been suggested and approved by Mr. and Mrs. White, and
others, which I wish now to impart to you.&nbsp; My friends recommend me, 
if I desire to secure permanent success, to delay commencing the school for
six months longer, and by all means to contrive, by hook or by crook, to 
spend the intervening time in some school on the continent.&nbsp; They say 
schools in England are so numerous, competition so great, that without some
such step towards attaining superiority we shall probably have a very hard 
struggle, and may fail in the end.&nbsp; They say, moreover, that the loan 
of &pound;100, which you have been so kind as to offer us, will, perhaps, 
not be all required now, as Miss Wooler will lend us the furniture; and 
that, if the speculation is intended to be a good and successful one, half 
the sum, at least, ought to be laid out in the manner I have mentioned, 
thereby insuring a more speedy repayment both of interest and 
principal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would not go to France or to Paris.&nbsp; I would go to 
Brussels, in Belgium.&nbsp; The cost of the journey there, at the dearest 
rate of travelling, would be &pound;5; living is there little more than 
half as dear as it is in England, and the facilities for education are 
equal or superior to any other place in Europe.&nbsp; In half a year, I 
could acquire a thorough familiarity with French.&nbsp; I could improve 
greatly in Italian, and even get a dash of German, <i>i.e.</i>, providing 
my health continued as good as it is now.&nbsp; Martha Taylor is now 
staying in Brussels, at a first-rate establishment there.&nbsp; I should 
not think of going to the Ch&acirc;teau de Kockleberg, where she is 
resident, as the terms are much too high; but if I wrote to her, she, with 
the assistance of Mrs. Jenkins, the wife of the British Consul, would be 
able to secure me a cheap and decent residence and respectable 
protection.&nbsp; I should have the opportunity of seeing her frequently, 
she would make me acquainted with the city; and, with the assistance of her
cousins, I should probably in time be introduced to connections far more 
improving, polished, and cultivated, than any I have yet known.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These are advantages which would turn to vast account, when we 
actually commenced a school&mdash;and, if Emily could share them with me, 
only for a single half-year, we could take a footing in the world 
afterwards which we can never do now.&nbsp; I say Emily instead of Anne; 
for Anne might take her turn at some future period, if our school 
answered.&nbsp; I feel certain, while I am writing, that you will see the 
propriety of what I say; you always like to use your money to the best 
advantage; you are not fond of making shabby purchases; when you do confer 
a favour, it is often done in style; and depend upon it &pound;50, or 
&pound;100, thus laid out, would be well employed.&nbsp; Of course, I know 
no other friend in the world to whom I could apply on this subject except 
yourself.&nbsp; I feel an absolute conviction that, if this advantage were 
allowed us, it would be the making of us for life.&nbsp; Papa will perhaps 
think it a wild and ambitious scheme; but who ever rose in the world 
without ambition?&nbsp; When he left Ireland to go to Cambridge University,
he was as ambitious as I am now.&nbsp; I want us all to go on.&nbsp; I know
we have talents, and I want them to be turned to account.&nbsp; I look to 
you, aunt, to help us.&nbsp; I think you will not refuse.&nbsp; I know, if 
you consent, it shall not be my fault if you ever repent your 
kindness.&nbsp; With love to all, and the hope that you are all 
well,&mdash;Believe me, dear aunt, your affectionate niece,</p>

dramatised by several hands, the play has never been as popular as one 
might suppose from a story of such thrilling incident.&nbsp; I can find no 
trace of the particular version which is referred to in this letter, but in
the next year the novel was dramatised by John Brougham, the actor and 
dramatist, and produced in New York on March 26, 1849.&nbsp; Brougham is 
rather an interesting figure.&nbsp; An Irishman by birth, he had a 
chequered experience of every phase of theatrical life both in London and 
New York.&nbsp; It was he who adapted &lsquo;The Queen&rsquo;s Motto&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Lady Audley&rsquo;s Secret,&rsquo; and he collaborated with Dion
Boucicault in &lsquo;London Assurance.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1849 he seems to 
have been managing Niblo&rsquo;s Garden in New York, and in the following 
year the Lyceum Theatre in Broadway.&nbsp; Miss Wemyss took the title role 
in <i>Jane Eyre</i>, J. Gilbert was Rochester, and Mrs. J. Gilbert was Lady
Ingram; and though the play proved only moderately successful, it was 
revived in 1856 at Laura Keene&rsquo;s Varieties at New York, with Laura 
Keene as Jane Eyre.&nbsp; This version has been published by Samuel French,
and is also in Dick&rsquo;s <i>Penny Plays</i>.&nbsp; Divided into five 
Acts and twelve scenes, Brougham starts the story at Lowood Academy.&nbsp; 
The second Act introduces us to Rochester&rsquo;s house, and the curtain 
descends in the fourth as Jane announces that the house is in flames.&nbsp;
At the end of the fifth, Brougham reproduced <i>verbatim</i> much of the 
conversation of the dialogue between Rochester and Jane.&nbsp; Perhaps the 
best-known dramatisation of the novel was that by the late W. G. Wills, who
divided the story into four Acts.&nbsp; His play was produced on Saturday, 
December 23, 1882, at the Globe Theatre, by Mrs. Bernard-Beere, with the 
following cast:&mdash;</p>

whom his opinion and advice are requested, is a female in her 29th 
year.&nbsp; A peculiar reserve of character renders it difficult to draw 
from her all the symptoms of her malady, but as far as they can be 
ascertained they are as follows:&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her appetite failed; she evinced a continual thirst, with a craving for 
acids, and required a constant change of beverage.&nbsp; In appearance she 
grew rapidly emaciated; her pulse&mdash;the only time she allowed it to be 
felt&mdash;was found to be 115 per minute.&nbsp; The patient usually 
appeared worse in the forenoon, she was then frequently exhausted and 
drowsy; toward evening she often seemed better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Expectoration accompanies the cough.&nbsp; The shortness of 
breath is aggravated by the slightest exertion.&nbsp; The patient&rsquo;s 
sleep is supposed to be tolerably good at intervals, but disturbed by 
paroxysms of coughing.&nbsp; Her resolution to contend against illness 
being very fixed, she has never consented to lie in bed for a single 
day&mdash;she sits up from 7 in the morning till 10 at night.&nbsp; All 
medical aid she has rejected, insisting that Nature should be left to take 
her own course.&nbsp; She has taken no medicine, but occasionally, a mild 
aperient and Locock&rsquo;s cough wafers, of which she has used about 3 per
diem, and considers their effect rather beneficial.&nbsp; Her diet, which 
she regulates herself, is very simple and light.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The patient has hitherto enjoyed pretty good health, though she 
has never looked strong, and the family constitution is not supposed to be 
robust.&nbsp; Her temperament is highly nervous.&nbsp; She has been 
accustomed to a sedentary and studious life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If Dr. Epps can, from what has here been stated, give an opinion 
on the case and prescribe a course of treatment, he will greatly oblige the
patient&rsquo;s friends.</p>

him:&mdash;&lsquo;Perhaps I ought to remark that, on the premature and

.&nbsp; there came as his successor, another Irish curate, Mr. 
Macarthey.&nbsp; I am happy to be able to inform you, <i>with truth</i>, 
that this gentleman did as much credit to his country as Malone had done it
discredit; he proved himself as decent, decorous, and conscientious, as 
Peter was rampant, boisterous, and&mdash;(this last epithet I choose to 
suppress, because it would let the cat out of the bag).&nbsp; He laboured 
faithfully in the parish; the schools, both Sunday and day-schools, 
flourished under his sway like green bay-trees.&nbsp; Being human, of 
course he had his faults; these, however, were proper, steady-going, 
clerical faults: the circumstance of finding himself invited to tea with a 
dissenter would unhinge him for a week; the spectacle of a Quaker wearing 
his hat in the church, the thought of an unbaptized fellow-creature being 
interred with Christian rites&mdash;these things could make strange havoc 
in Mr. Macarthey&rsquo;s physical and mental economy; otherwise he was sane
and rational, diligent and charitable.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Shirley</i>, chap.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
